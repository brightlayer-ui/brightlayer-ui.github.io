# Doc-It (a.k.a. pxblue.etn.com)
Doc-It is the source code for the pxblue.etn.com documentation site for Power Xpert Blue 2.0. The site is built to both provide documentation on how to use the system, but also as an example of how to use it. The entire site is using using the PX Blue design system - built with React+Redux and Material UI.

## Contributing
To contribute to the documentation site, you will need to clone a local copy of the repository (using SSH or HTTP):

```
git clone ssh://git@esgit.tcc.etn.com:7999/blue/doc-it.git
git clone http://EXXXXXXX@esgit.tcc.etn.com:7990/scm/blue/doc-it.git
```

You can then install the necessary dependencies and run a local instance with the following commands:

```
cd Doc-it
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Project Structure
This project uses a react skeleton to handle the functional aspects of the site, including navigation, routing, etc. However, the majority of the site content is written in markdown files to simplify the ability to add and update content. This is made possible through the use of the [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) converter.

### Folder Structure
The folder structure of the application is likewise segregated to keep the application and the content separate.

```

## Builds and Deployment
The Doc-it project is configured with automated builds and deployment scripts. 

When changes are committed to the Dev branch, they are automatically run through the test scripts and if the tests pass, the site is deployed to the staging server in Azure.

When changes are committed to the master branch and the tests pass, the changes are automatically deployed to pxblue.etn.com.
