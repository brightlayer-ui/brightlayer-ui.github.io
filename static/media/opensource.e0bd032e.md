# Open Source

We are proud to announce that PX Blue is now open source!  PX Blue resources are now available as a collection of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~px-blue) packages, [GitHub](http://www.github.com/pxblue) projects, and live [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/@px-blue) code examples to help teams build beautiful applications more quickly and easily.


## Why Open Source?

Most modern software applications are not built in a vacuum - typically they make use of a variety of open source libraries. PX Blue applications are no exception. So to make the process of using PX Blue more consistent with other libraries and simplify the delivery mechanism, we have made our resources available in the same way.

Publishing these resources publicly will also allow us to continuously deliver updates and improvements seamlessly to development teams. 

To learn more about adding these resources into your projects, refer to the updated Framework Guides.
If you are interested in contributing to PX Blue, please check out our [Sharing Code](/community/sharing) overview.

## Licensing
PX Blue is licensed under the [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/pxblue/themes/blob/master/LICENSE) license agreement. The text of this license can be found in any of our resource repositories on GitHub and NPM. You should include this license information in a comment block in any of your projects that make use of PX Blue assets (i.e., themes, colors, icons).
