# Getting Started with Angular

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new PX Blue project using Angular. Alternatively, you can start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/pxblue) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

## Creating a Project
The fastest way to create an Angular application is to use the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/). Once you have created your project, you can follow the instructions below for integrating PX Blue. 

## Including the Component Libraries
### Angular Material
Angular projects should make use of the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) component library. Our PX Blue themes are designed to work with these components. 

```
yarn add @angular/material
```

For detailed documentation about the various components available in Angular Material, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [Angular Material Documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/).

### PX Blue Components
Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for Eaton applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:
```
yarn add @pxblue/angular-components
```


## Adding PX Blue Themes
By default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [PX Blue theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes), first install it:
```
yarn add @pxblue/themes
```
Installing the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the PX Blue [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors) package. In order to use the PX Blue themes and font (Open Sans), you will need to modify your angular.json file "styles" entries (there is one under "build" and one under "test") to include the PX Blue themes and Open Sans reference:
```
"styles": [
    "src/styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/@pxblue/themes/angular/theme.scss",
    "./node_modules/typeface-open-sans"
],
```
### Applying the Theme
You can apply the theme to your application by adding the proper class to your application's top-level element:
```
// Default Theme
<app-root class="pxb-blue">

// Dark Theme
<app-root class="pxb-blue-dark">
```
> If you do not specify a theme class, your application will use the default Material theme.

You can access the fonts using mat-typography, e.g.:
```
<section class="mat-typography>
   <h1>H1 Text</h1>
   <h2>H2 Text</h2>
   <p>Paragraph text</p>
   <div class="body-2">Bold body copy</div>
</section>
```

You can access theme colors as well, e.g.:

```
<mat-toolbar color="primary">My App</mat-toolbar>
```

More details about applying themes in your application can be found in [Theming your Angular Material app](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).

## Code Formatting/Style
PX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the PX Blue team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/code-standards).


## Browser Support
Angular and Angular Material will work with any modern browser. For specific details, you can view their official support pages:

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support)
- [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2#browser-and-screen-reader-support)

> As of Angular 8, the Angular CLI no longer includes support for IE11 by default. If you need to support this browser (not recommended), you can configure your project to support it manually ([Contact us](/community/contactus) for assistance).

## License Information
[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.
