# Getting Started with React

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new PX Blue project using React. Alternatively, you can start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/pxblue) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

## Creating a Project
The fastest way to create an React application is to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Once you have created your project, you can follow the instructions below for integrating PX Blue.

## Including the Component Libraries
### Material UI
React projects should make use of the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) component library. Our PX Blue themes are designed to work with these components. You'll also want to install the icons.

```
yarn add @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

For detailed documentation about the various components available in Material UI, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [Material UI Documentation](https://material-ui.com/).

### PX Blue Components
Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/pxblue/react-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for Eaton applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:
```
yarn add @pxblue/react-components
```

## Adding PX Blue Themes
By default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [PX Blue theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes), first install it:
```
yarn add @pxblue/themes
```
Installing the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the PX Blue [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors) package.

### Applying the Theme
Import the theme files, Material UI theme provider, and **Open Sans** font into your application, e.g. in App.js:
```
import { 
    MuiThemeProvider, 
    createMuiTheme 
} from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import CssBaseline from '@material-ui/core/CssBaseline';
import * as PXBThemes from '@pxblue/themes/react';
require ("typeface-open-sans");
```

If you are looking to add the theme to your whole application, you would simply add a ```<MuiThemeProvider>``` around your top-level component and pass it the theme you want to use, e.g.:

```
<MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blue)}>
    <CssBaseline/>
    <MyApp/>
</MuiThemeProvider>
```

If you want to use multiple themes in different areas of your site, you just need to wrap those components in another ```<MuiThemeProvider>``` - these can be nested and you can change the theme dynamically by binding to state or prop variables, e.g.:

```
<MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blue)}>
    <CssBaseline/>
    <MyApp>
        <MyNormalComponent/>
        <MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blueDark)}>
            <MySidebarComponent/>
        </MuiThemeProvider>
    </MyApp>
</MuiThemeProvider/>
```

> **NOTE:** Material-UI recommends keeping your use of MuiThemeProvider to a minimum for better performance. In most cases, you'll be fine to use a single theme for your entire application and use one-off styling via CSS when necessary.

You can read about [React Theming](https://material-ui-next.com/customization/themes/) to learn more.

## Code Formatting/Style
PX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the PX Blue team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/code-standards).

> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.

## Browser Support
React and Material UI will work with any modern browser. For specific details, you can view their official support pages:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/supported-platforms/)

> The latest Create React App CLI does not include support for IE11 by default. If you need to support this browser (not recommended), you can configure your project to support it manually ([Contact us](/community/contactus) for assistance).

## License Information
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.
