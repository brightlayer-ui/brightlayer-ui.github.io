# Getting Started with React

There's two ways to get started using PX Blue with React:
1. If you are starting a new project, you can use the PX Blue Project Tool to automatically create an application with PX Blue integration.
2. If you have an existing project, you can follow the steps below to integrate the PX Blue resources into your application.

## Integrating PX Blue
To integrate PX Blue with your React project, you will need:

1. An existing React application
   	* This can be an existing application if you have on already of a project generated by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
2. Material-UI Component Library
   	* Our themes are built for the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) component library. It can be installed by running the following in your project root:
        ```
        yarn add @material-ui/core
        ```
3. PX Blue Themes for React:
   	* These are available from npm as [@pxblue/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes)
	* See below for installation instructions 

### Theming your application
Install the PX Blue theme files from npm:
```
yarn add @pxblue/themes
```

Then import the theme files and the Material UI theme provider into your application, e.g. in App.js:
```
import { 
    MuiThemeProvider, 
    createMuiTheme 
} from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import * as PXBThemes from '@pxblue/themes/react';
require ("typeface-open-sans");
```

If you are looking to add the theme to your whole appplication, you would simply add a ```<MuiThemeProvider>``` around your top-level component and pass it the theme you want to use, e.g.:

```
<MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blue)}>
    <MyApp/>
</MuiThemeProvider>
```

If you want to use multiple themes in different areas of your site, you just need to wrap those components in another ```<MuiThemeProvider>``` - these can be nested and you can change the theme dynamically by binding to state or prop variables, e.g.:

```
<MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blue)}>
    <MyApp>
        <MyNormalComponent/>
        <MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(this.props.currentAlarmTheme)}>
            <MyAlarmComponent/>
        </MuiThemeProvider>
    </MyApp>
</MuiThemeProvider/>
```
