# Using Power Xpert Blue Themes

### Available Themes

Power Xpert Blue ships with four distinct themes:

- **Blue** is the default theme for all Eaton applications. It should be applied at the root level of your app. It provides a variety of shades of blue for use in buttons, toolbars, etc. The standard background color is a light gray.
- **Blue-Dark** is complementary to the Blue theme. The primary use for Blue-Dark is in detail panels (i.e., information sidebars). It provides various shades of gray as well as a secondary blue color that matches the primary blue in the Blue theme (e.g., for buttons).
- **Red** is used when you need to indicate an alarm or error condition on a section of your application. It should be applied on particular sub-components to show specifically where the alarm has occurred. In general, it should not be applied at the root level of the application. The Red theme provides assorted shades of red for use in buttons, toolbars, etc. The standard background color is a light gray.
- **Red-Dark** is complementary to the Red theme. The primary use for Red-Dark is in detail panels (i.e., information sidebars) that accompany a view that uses the Red theme. It provides various shades of gray as well as a secondary red color that matches the primary red in the Red theme (e.g., for buttons).

> **NOTE:** Using multiple themes in your application is optional. You may stick to using a single theme (Blue) for your entire application and then apply one-off styling where necessary to achieve other effects. All of the PX Blue colors are available individually for use in the application.
