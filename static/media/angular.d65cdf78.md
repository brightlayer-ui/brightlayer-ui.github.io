# Getting Started with Angular

There's two ways to get started using PX Blue with Angular:
1. If you are starting a new project, you can use the PX Blue Project Tool to automatically create an application with PX Blue integration.
2. If you have an existing project, you can follow the steps below to integrate the PX Blue resources into your application.

## Integrating PX Blue
To integrate PX Blue with your Angular project, you will need:

1. An existing Angular application
    * This can be an existing application if you have one already or a project generated by the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/).

2. Angular Material Component Library
    * Our themes are built for the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) component library. It can be installed by running the following in your project root:
        ```
        yarn add @angular/material
        ```

3. PX Blue Themes for Angular:
    * These are available from npm as [@pxblue/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes)
    * See below for installation instructions 

## Theming your application
Install the PX Blue theme files from npm:
```
yarn add @pxblue/themes
```

Then import the theme files into your application's main stylesheet:
```
@import '~@pxblue/themes/angular/theme.scss';
```
> Note: Your project must be configured for pre-processing SASS.

In order for your application to use the Open Sans font, you will also need to include the relative path to the npm package typeface-open-sans in your Angular.json file:
```
//build styles
styles[
    "styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/typeface-open-sans"
    ]
...
//testing styles
styles[
    "styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/typeface-open-sans"
    ]
```
Then, in your application, you can access fonts using mat-typography, e.g.:

```
<section class="mat-typography>
   <h1>H1 Text</h1>
   <h2>H2 Text</h2>
   <p>Paragraph text</p>
   <div class="body-2">Bold body copy</div>
</section>
```

You can access theme colors as well, e.g.:

```
<mat-toolbar color="primary">My App</mat-toolbar>
```

More details about applying themes in your application can be found in [Theming your Angular Material app](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).
