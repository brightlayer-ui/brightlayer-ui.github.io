# Sharing Code

One of the primary goals of Power Xpert Blue is to eliminate the need for teams to duplicate effort. If you have built something using Power Xpert Blue that you think would benefit other Eaton development teams, we would love to hear from you. Please <a href="mailto:pxblue@eaton.com">Contact Us</a> and we will make your code available to other Power Xpert Blue adopter teams.

We build our code examples using [StackBlitz](http://www.stackblitz.com). If you have not used this tool before, it's a terrific online IDE that eliminates the headache of dependency management and makes sharing code snippets easier. We recommend that you try it out when submitting code samples to speed up the process.

## Our Code
