Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators ",Object(A.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"without")," property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded)."),Object(A.b)("p",null,"One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., ",Object(A.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"test-id")," or ",Object(A.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"dev-id"),"). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification."),Object(A.b)("pre",null,Object(A.b)("code",Object.assign({parentName:"pre"},{className:"language-html"}),'\x3c!-- Component code --\x3e\n<button id="login-button" class="default-button">Login</button>\n\n\x3c!-- Selector to use in a test --\x3e\nWebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id("login-button"));\n')),Object(A.b)("h2",null,"Testing Frameworks"),Object(A.b)("p",null,"There are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests.

As a first step, it's helpful to decide if this is going to be a web application, mobile application, or both. Here is a run-down of these different types of applications.\\n\\n## Web Applications\\n\\nThese applications are accessible over the web. They can be accessed from any device with a network connection and a web browser (personal computer, mobile phone). To learn more about what a web application entails, check out our [Web App](/get-started/web) guide.\\n\\n## Mobile Applications\\n\\nMobile applications are intended to be used strictly on mobile devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, etc.). These can be downloaded directly to the device (e.g., from the App Store or Google Play) and do not have to be connected to the Internet to run. To learn more about what a mobile application entails, including the difference between native and hybrid apps, check out our [Mobile App](/get-started/mobile) guide.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Deciding What Kind of Application to Build\\n\\nWith a new project, the nature of the project often determines which type of application you will need.\\n\\n## This Project is Replacing an Existing Product\\n\\nThink about the existing product and how it is used. Gather feedback from existing users and identify areas for improvement.\\n\\nIn general, you will want to at least provide the same type of application as before (unless user feedback suggests that it's not what they need). If you had a web application before, you may want to build a responsive web application this time. Alternatively, you may want to expand on the existing product by offering a mobile application.\\n\\n## This is a Brand New Product (never before seen)\\n\\nThink about how the product will be used. Does it offer features that users will want to access on the go? Is it going to be actively used in the field, or is it something users will more likely use from their desk?\\n\\nIn general, you can't go wrong with a web application. If you do your due diligence and design a properly responsive application, you will be able to access it from any connected device, including mobile. If you suspect that the primary mode of interacting with the application will be from a mobile device or if the application needs to work offline, you may want to consider building a dedicated mobile app.\\n\"},\"/get-started/web\":{\"title\":\"Web Apps\",\"text\":\"\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: web application introduction framework --\x3e\\n\\n# Web Applications\\n\\nWeb applications are everywhere. As the name suggests, they can be accessed from any device that can access the Internet. This means they have a lot of flexibility, but that comes with extra responsibility when you design them.\\n\\n## Responsive Design\\n\\nResponsive web design is critical for web applications today. With a nearly infinite variety of web-capable devices available, you'll want your application to look great on all of them. It's much easier to design a responsive web application if you start with mobile designs first. If you can fit your features into a mobile-sized display, it's much easier to scale up to a desktop size than it is to design for desktop and then scale everything down to mobile.\\n\\n## Get Started With a Web App\\n\\nThere are a lot of wonderful web applications out there and tons of options for how to proceed. Most modern applications are built with HTML / CSS and sit inside a JavaScript framework. If your application needs to be very small, or if you don't really have a need for a JavaScript infrastructure, you can certainly build static applications with just HTML and CSS. You can also use \\\"vanilla\\\" JavaScript without the need for including an entire JavaScript framework in your application. We support both Angular and React in the PX Blue design system.\\n\\nFor a comparison of the pros / cons of each of these frameworks, see our [Framework Introduction](/development/frameworks-web/intro).\\n\\nOne of the goals of PX Blue is to maximize maintainability and code re-use by standardizing on certain technologies. If you want to use a different framework from those that we support, you'll need to consider the trade-offs.\\n\"},\"/get-started/mobile\":{\"title\":\"Mobile Apps\",\"text\":\"import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: mobile hybrid compare comparison native application --\x3e\\n\\n# Mobile Applications\\n\\nMobile applications are very popular. They can be accessed anywhere you can take your mobile device, both online and offline, and can take greater advantage of device features and capabilities than a web application.\\n\\nMobile applications come in two primary varieties: native apps and hybrid apps.\\n\\n## Native mobile apps\\n\\n-   Must be built using the native code that runs on mobile devices. In general, that means Java (Android) or Swift / Objective C (iOS)\\n-   Should adhere to the design and development guidelines for the intended platforms:\\n    -   [iOS Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/)\\n        \x3c!-- markdown-link-check-disable --\x3e\\n    -   [Android Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html)\\n        \x3c!-- markdown-link-check-enable --\x3e\\n\\nAndroid and iOS are the dominant players in the mobile market, but you should check with your particular users to see what is most prevalent in your target market.\\n\\n## Hybrid mobile apps\\n\\n-   Maintained as a single code base that is deployed to multiple different device types (namely iOS and Android)\\n-   Built using web-technologies (i.e. JavaScript)\\n    -   low barrier to entry for web developers\\n-   Implemented differently depending on the framework:\\n    -   some compile down to native components\\n    -   others render all content in a web view (essentially a web page running inside of an app)\\n\\n<Divider style={{}} />\\n\\n# Comparing the two approaches\\n\\n## Native mobile apps\\n\\n-   Guaranteed to look & feel like an app since it uses native components\\n-   Requires more specialized development expertise\\n-   Requires separate code bases for different operating systems\\n    -   Longer development time\\n    -   More expensive / more maintenance\\n\\n## Hybrid mobile apps\\n\\n-   Reduces development time thanks to shared code base\\n-   Provides more technology options\\n    -   Many different hybrid platforms / tools available\\n-   Allows for a consistent look on different platforms\\n-   Makes development easier by using web technologies, but it's also easier to make something that doesn't follow standard mobile patterns\\n\\n<Divider style={{}} />\\n\\n# So, which one should you use?\\n\\nOur recommendation for mobile applications is to take a hybrid approach. This will allow you to deploy multiple versions of your application (i.e. iOS and Android) from a single code base. We offer support for several different approaches to building hybrid apps (see our [Mobile Framework Introduction](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro) to learn about the technologies we support).\\n\\nIf you prefer to build a strictly native app and adhere to the PX Blue standards, there are ways of doing this using [Material Design Components for Android](https://material.io/develop/android/) and [Material Design Components for iOS](https://material.io/develop/ios/).\\n\\n> **NOTE:** PX Blue support for native mobile applications is limited - if you are planning to go this route, please [Contact us](/community/contactus).\\n\"},\"/development/environment\":{\"title\":\"Environment Setup\",\"text\":\"import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: developer develop environment guide tutorial --\x3e\\n\\n# Setting up Your Development Environment\\n\\nGetting started is often the most frustrating part of application development. Fortunately, many of the modern JavaScript frameworks have made great strides in providing tools to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Below, we walk through the basics of getting your system set up to develop.\\n\\n## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\\n\\nThere are a bunch of different IDEs on the market, and in general you should be able to use any of these that you like and are comfortable with. If you don't have a personal preference, we recommend trying [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - it is quite excellent and comes with a variety of tools to make your development experience seamless. And it's free!\\n\\n## Git\\n\\nChances are, you probably want to keep your application in source control. Git is one of the big players in this space (it's also the backbone for BitBucket).\\n\\nYou may already have git installed. To check, run:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit --version\\n```\\n\\nin a command prompt. If you don't have git installed, you can download it from the [Git Website](http://git-scm.com/downloads).\\n\\nIf you are behind a proxy, you'll also need to set up the git proxies as well:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit config --global http.proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\\ngit config --global https.proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\\n```\\n\\nThe proxy addresses may vary depending on your location. Consult your local IT department if you\u2019re not sure.\\n\\n## Node\\n\\nThe majority of JavaScript frameworks (and PX Blue resources) are available via the Node Package Manager (NPM). This package manager allows you to install a variety of third party tools, packages, and other dependencies that you need for your applications. To use NPM, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\\n\\n## Yarn\\n\\nOur projects and example code are set up to be run using yarn, but if you prefer, you're welcome to use NPM in your projects instead. Instructions for installing yarn on various operating systems can be found on the [Yarn Website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\\n\\nTo check if you have yarn installed, run:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn -v\\n```\\n\\nfrom a command prompt. If you are behind a proxy, you will also need to configure your proxy settings. It may be sufficient for you to set `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` in your environment variables. However, you may need to also explicitly set proxy values for yarn:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn config set proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\\nyarn config set https-proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\\n```\\n\\nThe proxy addresses may vary depending on your location. Consult your local IT department if you\u2019re not sure. Once you have configured the proxy, you should be able to install packages by using:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add <package-name>\\n```\\n\\n> If you are installing packages globally using yarn, you will need to ensure that your PATH variable has an entry pointing to your global yarn install directory. This location will vary based on your operating system.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Hybrid App Development\\n\\nIf you are setting up for building a mobile app, there are some additional steps you will want to take to prepare. The following requirements are the basics. Depending on your selected [framework](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro), there will be other specific setup steps detailed in our Getting Started Guides.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n### Hardware\\n\\nMobile development is resource-intensive, so you will need a development machine that is up to the task. Your machine should at least match the following minimum requirements:\\n\\n-   a Mac (if you plan on building or testing iOS locally)\\n-   16GB RAM or more (running multiple emulators can easily push you over 20GB)\\n-   Solid State Hard Drive (SSD)\\n-   5/6 Gen Core i7 with Virtualization Technology or better\\n\\n### Software\\n\\nThere are a few software tools that you will need before you can get started:\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdown-link-check-disable --\x3e\\n\\n-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (required for building for Android)\\n    \x3c!-- markdown-link-check-enable --\x3e\\n-   [xCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Mac-only, required for building for iOS)\\n\"},\"/development/cli\":{\"title\":\"PX Blue CLI\",\"text\":\"import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: cli command line interface new project start --\x3e\\n\\n# PX Blue CLI\\n\\nThe PX Blue CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool for quickly starting a new project using PX Blue. It will automatically create a skeleton project in your chosen framework, add Material and PX Blue component library dependencies, include and integrate PX Blue themes, typography, and colors, and optionally add PX Blue code formatting and linting profiles.\\n\\nTo start a new project with the CLI:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new\\n```\\n\\nFor more detailed information and usage instructions, check out the [@pxblue/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli) package on NPM.\\n\\n## Supported Frameworks\\n\\nThe PX Blue CLI works with all PX Blue supported frameworks: Angular, React, Ionic, and React Native.

Both are open source JavaScript frameworks with large communities of support and both have open source component libraries implementing Material Design. The two are quite comparable and you would not go wrong by choosing either, but there are some notable differences outlined below.\\n\\n## Angular (with Angular Material)\\n\\n-   A comprehensive framework, with a lot of built-in features and functionality\\n-   Written in TypeScript (superset of JavaScript with strong variable typing)\\n-   Structured way of organizing your entire application (if following the Angular CLI)\\n-   May be more accessible to developers with greater back-end or full-stack experience\\n-   Maintained by Google\\n-   Learn more on the [Angular website](https://angular.io/)\\n\\n## React (with Material UI)\\n\\n-   A UI library for building custom Web Components / Applications\\n-   Can be combined with additional libraries (e.g. Redux) to be a more comprehensive framework\\n-   Virtual DOM allows for fewer re-renders (i.e., faster UI updates)\\n-   May be more accessible to developers with greater experience with JavaScript and front-end development\\n-   Maintained by Facebook\\n-   Learn more on the [React website](https://reactjs.org/)\\n\\n<Divider style={{}} />\\n\\n# Which framework should I use?\\n\\nChoosing a framework is entirely up to you. They each have their own pros and cons, so you'll need to decide what is best for your application. In general, if you have developers who are very familiar with a particular framework, it might be worthwhile to use that framework to avoid any unnecessary learning curves associated with a new one. If you don't have development resources yet, you will probably want to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the available frameworks to decide what is most appropriate for your application. Feel free to reach out to us for assistance if needed.\\n\\nIf you choose to use one of these frameworks, have a look at our Guides for using them with PX Blue:\\n\\n-   [Angular Guide](/development/frameworks-web/angular)\\n-   [React Guide](/development/frameworks-web/react)\\n\"},\"/development/frameworks-web/angular\":{\"title\":\"Angular Guide\",\"text\":\"import { Divider } from '../../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: angular web framework guide tutorial --\x3e\\n\\n# Getting Started with Angular\\n\\nThe following instructions will guide you through starting a new PX Blue project using Angular. Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/pxblue) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).\\n\\n## Using the PX Blue CLI\\n\\nThe fastest way to start a new PX Blue project is to use the [PX Blue CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/)) with all of the necessary PX Blue dependencies pre-configured. To start an Angular project:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new angular\\n```\\n\\nYou will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the PX Blue eslint and prettier configurations files.\\n\\nThe PX Blue CLI will automatically include:\\n\\n-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))\\n-   PX Blue Component Library ([@pxblue/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-components))\\n-   PX Blue Themes ([@pxblue/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes))\\n-   PX Blue Icons ([@pxblue/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons))\\n-   PX Blue Colors ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors))\\n-   Open Sans web font ([typeface-open-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeface-open-sans))\\n-   PX Blue ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@pxblue/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/eslint-config) / [@pxblue/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/prettier-config))\\n-   IE 11 Support\\n\\nFor detailed usage instructions, refer to the [PX Blue CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli).\\n\\n## Using an Existing Project\\n\\nIf you have an existing project and would like to integrate PX Blue, you can follow the manual integration instructions below.

The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using either the [React Native Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) (recommended) or [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/)) with all of the necessary PX Blue dependencies pre-configured. To start a React Native project:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new react-native\\n```\\n\\nYou will be asked to provide a name for your project, select a CLI to use, choose whether you would like to use TypeScript or JavaScript, and for TypeScript projects, you'll be asked if you want to use the PX Blue eslint and prettier configurations files.\\n\\nThe PX Blue CLI will automatically include:\\n\\n-   React Native Paper Component Library ([react-native-paper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-paper))\\n-   PX Blue Component Library ([@pxblue/react-native-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-components))\\n-   PX Blue Themes ([@pxblue/react-native-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-themes))\\n-   Material Icons ([react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons))\\n-   PX Blue Icons ([@pxblue/icons-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons-svg))\\n-   PX Blue Colors ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors))\\n-   Open Sans font\\n-   PX Blue ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@pxblue/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/eslint-config) / [@pxblue/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/prettier-config))\\n-   Testing libraries ([jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) / [react-test-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer))\\n\\nFor detailed usage instructions, refer to the [PX Blue CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli).\\n\\n## Using an Existing Project\\n\\nIf you have an existing project and would like to integrate PX Blue, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the PX Blue CLI.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Manual PX Blue Integration\\n\\nBefore taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the PX Blue CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.\\n\\n## Including the Component Libraries\\n\\n### Material Components\\n\\nReact Native projects should make use of the [React-Native-Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) component library. Our PX Blue themes are designed to work with these components. You'll also want to install [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) to access the Material icons.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons\\n// or\\nyarn add react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons\\n```\\n\\n### PX Blue Components\\n\\nWe have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/pxblue/react-native-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for PX Blue applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save @pxblue/react-components\\n// or\\nyarn add @pxblue/react-native-components\\n```\\n\\n## Adding PX Blue Themes\\n\\nIf you are using the recommended component libraries, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme by default. To use the PX Blue theme, first install it:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save @pxblue/react-native-themes\\n// or\\nyarn add @pxblue/react-native-themes\\n```\\n\\n> Using the PX Blue React Native theme **requires** that you add the Open Sans font to your application. You can learn how to do this by reading the instructions for [Vanilla React Native](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-custom-fonts-ccc9aacf9e5e) or [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-custom-fonts/). You can find the fonts [here](https://github.com/pxblue/cli-helpers/tree/master/fonts).\\n\\n> When using Expo, you will need to specify the name for each font weight you load using the format OpenSans-`<Weight>`, e.g., OpenSans-SemiBold. Refer to one of our React Native demos for reference.\\n\\n## Applying the Theme\\n\\nImport the theme files and React Native Paper theme provider into your application, e.g. in App.js:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { Provider as ThemeProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\\nimport * as PXBThemes from '@pxblue/react-native-themes';\\n...\\n<ThemeProvider theme={PXBThemes.blue}>\\n    <App />\\n</ThemeProvider>\\n```\\n\\nFor detailed information about theming, refer to the react-native-paper [theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html).\\n\\n> NOTE: This theme only applies to the components in the react-native-paper and @pxblue/react-native-components package. It will not theme the components from other third party libraries. If you wish to use our theme to style your own components, refer to the react-native-paper [theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html#using-the-theme-in-your-own-components).\\n\\n### Avoiding Repeated Styles\\n\\nTo avoid adding repeatedly adding inline styles to standard components, you can define your own component that applies the styles and use that throughout your application, e.g.:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// MyText.js\\nexport default MyText = ({style, children, ...other}) => (\\n    <Text {...other} style={StyleSheet.flatten([{/* Theme styles here */}, style])}>\\n        {children}\\n    </Text>\\n);\\n\\n// OtherFile.js\\nimport Text from 'path/to/MyText.js';\\n...\\n<Text>Themed Text Object</Text>\\n```\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Writing a React Native Application\\n\\nIf you are familiar with React development, React Native will be relatively simple to understand. The application logic remains the same, while the UI requires a little adjustment. Rather than typical HTML elements, React Native UIs are built with a special library of [Components](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis), including `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`, etc. React Native layouts are built exclusively using FlexBox.\\n\\n## Running your application\\n\\nAfter you've created your application with a CLI, it can be run from the command line:\\n\\n```sh\\ncd YourAppName\\n\\n// RNC CLI\\nnpm run <ios|android>\\n// or\\nyarn <ios|android>\\n\\n// Expo CLI (follow the on-screen instructions or use the web interface to open the app on a device)\\nnpm run start\\n// or\\nyarn start\\n```\\n\\nWhen you make changes to the source code, the application will automatically rebuild and update on the device.\\n\\n> To run on an Android emulator, the emulator must already be running or you will see an error message, \\\"No connected devices found.\\\"\\n\\n> On a Mac, you may be prompted to install watchman (`brew install watchman`) or update a few settings to run the application.\\n\\n## Ejecting from Expo\\n\\nIf you use Expo to create your project, there will come a time in your development when it becomes necessary to eject from Expo. The most common reason for this are for adding native libraries to your project.\\n\\nTo eject your app, run the following and follow the on-screen prompts (WARNING: Ejecting from Expo cannot be undone. Make sure you know what you are doing and have your project in source control before proceeding):\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm run eject\\n// or\\nyarn eject\\n```\\n\\n> -   At the first prompt, select 'Bare (first option)'\\n> -   At the second prompt, accept the default value (press Enter). Changing this can cause issues running your project.\\n> -   At the third prompt, enter a name for the solution folder.\\n\\nFor more information, read about [ejecting from Expo](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).\\n\\n## Final Build\\n\\nAfter ejecting from Expo, the process for creating a build is the same as for a standard native application. You can open the project folders in xCode (/ios/projectName.xcodeproj) or Android Studio (/android) and perform builds from the IDE. There are also npm scripts added to your package.json file during ejection that will allow you to perform builds from the command line. Depending on the version of React Native you are using, you may have to [manually bundle your JS code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44446523/unable-to-load-script-from-assets-index-android-bundle-on-windows) for Android.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Additional Information\\n\\n## RNC CLI vs. Expo CLI\\n\\nThere are two popular approaches to starting a new React Native project. The first (recommended) is to use the [React Native Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) and the second is to use the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/). The Expo CLI is nice for spinning up quick projects and demos, but to use certain libraries/plugins you will need to eject to vanilla React Native. For this reason, we recommend most production applications start with the RNC CLI instead to avoid the complications of ejecting.\\n\\n> **NOTE:** PX Blue examples are written using the Expo CLI. The primary reason for this is because it provides the ability to share live-running code examples via [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/).\\n\\n## Code Formatting / Style\\n\\nPX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the PX Blue team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/code-standards).\\n\\n> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.\\n\\n## Component recommendations\\n\\nThere are a lot of resources and components available on the market to help speed up your development and improve reusability. React Native also comes with a built-in component library. We recommend the following:\\n\\n-   Navigation\\n    -   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (JS-only implementation)\\n    -   [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/) (native implementation)\\n-   Component Libraries\\n    -   [React Native Built-in Components](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html)\\n    -   [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)\\n    -   [React Native Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/)\\n\\n## License Information\\n\\n[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/LICENSE) is available under the MIT License.\\n\"},\"/development/testing\":{\"title\":\"Testing\",\"text\":\"import { DemoCard, ImageGrid, MaterialDesignDescription, Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n# Testing Your PX Blue Applications\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: testing test unit e2e tdd bdd integration cypress --\x3e\\n\\nTesting is a critical component of successfully building and releasing an application. Despite the value and importance of testing, it is common for teams to overlook or neglect it. Testing should be considered from the very beginning of development, not as an afterthought once development is complete. In general, every time you write a new piece of code or update existing code, you should also write a test that verifies that your code is correct.\\n\\nThere are many [varieties of tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing), each with their own intended purpose. The most common types of tests are:\\n\\n-   **Unit Tests**: verify individual methods, functions, or components.\\n-   **Integration Tests**: verify that different modules or services in your application work together.\\n-   **Functional Tests**: verify the output of certain actions based on business requirements.\\n-   **End-to-end (E2E) Tests**: verify that user behaviors / workflows function as expected.\\n-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that the entire system meets the business requirements.\\n-   **Performance Tests**: verify that the system behaves correctly under heavy load.\\n-   **Smoke Tests: quick**: basic checks of the major features of the application.\\n\\nThis document focuses mainly on Unit Tests and E2E tests, as they are the easiest to automate.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Unit Tests\\n\\nUnit tests target the smallest pieces of your application (such as verifying inputs and outputs of a class method or function). These will likely make up the bulk of your tests because they are quick to write, easy to automate, and can help you achieve significant code coverage.\\n\\n> Code Coverage measures the percentage of your code that is verified by your tests.\\n\\nA unit test shouldn't have any external dependencies, such as other methods or APIs. By keeping unit tests isolated in this manner, it's easy to identify the cause of a failing test and implement a fix quickly. When you start combining features and methods together, you move into the realm of _integration testing_.\\n\\n## When to Write\\n\\nAs long as you are writing tests and achieving acceptable levels of coverage, the _when_ is not as important.\\n\\nSome teams elect to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, where unit tests are written prior to any code. In this situation the tests actually define the desired implementation of the application and the code is written to satisfy the tests.\\n\\nBehavior-Driven Development (BDD) is similar to TDD in that test cases are written prior to writing any applications code. However, these test cases focus more on the desired behavior (inputs and outputs) of the application, and less on the actual implementation. These are usually written in plain language rather than code.\\n\\nThe most important thing to keep in mind about tests is that they should provide confidence that the code and design are working as intended without issues in any scenario. For most teams, it's fine to write tests after features and functions are developed, so long as you write quality tests and achieve good coverage.\\n\\n## How to Write\\n\\nWhen unit testing components, the most effective tests are based on what is actually rendered on the screen rather than the internal implementation logic. The test should consider the application from the user's perspective and test things the user views and interacts with.\\n\\nFor example, consider testing an Open Button that should open a modal dialog when clicked. Your test should check that a button with the _Open_ label is rendered on the screen, and when it is clicked, the dialog is rendered on the screen with the correct content. You may be tempted to identify the button by a class or id, or test that a particular function is called when the button is pressed - these tests are not as effective because they are more likely to break if the implementation of the component changes, even though the end behavior is the same.\\n\\n-   Test what the user sees (i.e.,\u200arendered output) and what the user can do\u200a (i.e., interactions).\\n-   If there is visual change after an interaction, test for it.\\n-   If there is a value returned after an action, test for it.\\n\\n## Testing Frameworks\\n\\nAngular, React, and React Native all come with built-in unit testing frameworks. Ionic can be unit tested using the same tools you would use for a standard Angular application.\\n\\n### Angular\\n\\nThe Angular CLI comes pre-configured with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for unit testing. When you create a new project, sample tests are created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.spec.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\ncd your/project/root\\nng test\\n```\\n\\nThis will build your app and launch the browser with the test runner.\\n\\n### React\\n\\nThe Create React App CLI is pre-configured with the [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) testing framework. When creating a new project, a sample test is created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.test.js` or `test.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\ncd your/project/root\\nnpm run test\\n// or\\nyarn test\\n```\\n\\nThis will run your tests and show the pass / fail output in the terminal.\\n\\nThere are additional test utilities that complement Jest well. [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) provides access to [React Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) through the `react-dom` dependency. The PX Blue team has also made use of [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), a testing framework created by AirBnB, and [Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html).\\n\\n### React Native\\n\\nLike React, the React Native CLI also bundles Jest into your application. Most of the testing strategies and libraries can be shared between the two frameworks. You can also consider additional libraries like [React Native Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react-native).\\n\\n### Ionic\\n\\nWhen creating an Ionic project with Angular, the Angular CLI is used to generate the underlying project, so you have access to all the same testing tools as you would with a regular Angular project.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# End-to-End Testing\\n\\nEnd-to-end tests at a step above unit tests, both in terms of complexity and what they test. They focus primarily on the flow of the application, making sure that a user's journey through the application has the expected outcomes. These tests can generally be categorized as:\\n\\n-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that various features and flows meet the customer expectations.\\n-   **Regression Tests**: verify that existing functionality is not broken when new features are added.\\n\\nThey should cover user stories that span multiple components and views, such as signing up for an accounts, logging in and out of the application, updating a profile, etc. These tests are not concerned with the underlying state or implementation of the application - just the end results.\\n\\nEnd-to-end tests usually run in a browser against a live system (in the case of web, using a test runner that automates the browser). Automated E2E tests can take a long time to run because of all of the different pieces involved and the scope of the tests. You should try to optimize your testing pipeline to run tests in parallel to finish faster.\\n\\nFunctional tests alone will not give you enough test coverage to avoid regressions. Unit tests aim to provide code coverage depth, while functional tests provide coverage over the breadth of user test scenarios.\\n\\n## How to Write\\n\\nEnd-to-end tests rely on the ability to find elements on the screen and interact with them in an automated way. This means that you need a reliable mechanism for selecting elements. Depending on your testing framework, there are different ways to select elements, including:\\n\\n-   **CSS Selectors**: find elements by using CSS classes or rules (e.g., `.your-class-name`)\\n-   **Element Selectors**: find elements inside the elements (e.g., `#\\\\@\\\\@pxb-drawerlayout-content > div > header > div > button`)\\n-   **xPath Selectors**: find selector within xPath (e.g., `//*[@id=\\\"@@pxb-drawerlayout-content\\\"]/div/header/div/button`)\\n-   **ID Selectors**: find attribute id within elements (e.g., `#login-button`)\\n\\n> You can read more about different selector strategies on [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/css-selectors-in-selenium) and [software testing help](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/css-selector-selenium-locator-selenium-tutorial-6/).\\n\\nEach of these methods has their own advantages and disadvantages. A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators _without_ property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).\\n\\nOne way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `test-id` or `dev-id`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification.\\n\\n```html\\n\x3c!-- Component code --\x3e\\n<button id=\\\"login-button\\\" class=\\\"default-button\\\">Login</button>\\n\\n\x3c!-- Selector to use in a test --\x3e\\nWebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id(\\\"login-button\\\"));\\n```\\n\\n## Testing Frameworks\\n\\nThere are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests. Some of the more popular tools include:\\n\\n-   [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/)\\n-   [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)\\n-   [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html)\\n\\n### Selenium\\n\\nSelenium is a popular automation testing suite which can be used to automate the desktop and mobile web browser interactions. You can write test code in any of the languages supported by Selenium.\\n\\nSelenium test suite has several test frameworks available and each one can be customized to your project needs.\\n\\nFor more information, check out the browserstack [selenium guide](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-framework) or the official [selenium documentation](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium).\\n\\nThere are also a number of [Selenium tutorials](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/selenium-tutorial-1/) available online to help you get started.\\n\\n### Cypress\\n\\nCypress is a popular open source testing framework that boasts support for any modern JavaScript framework. It works well for E2E tests in both Angular and React applications and is easier to use than some of the more traditional tools, such as Selenium.\\n\\nFor a more detailed write-up on Cypress, check out the official [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements).\\n\\n### WebDriverIO\\n\\nWebdriverIO is a popular Javascript based test automation framework built on top of node.js. It is an open-source project developed for the automation testing community. WebdriverIO is extendible, compatible and feature-rich.\\n\\nFor more information, check out the official [Webdriver.io documentation](https://webdriver.io/) and their [getting started guide](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html).\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\"},\"/design/intro\":{\"title\":\"Introduction\",\"text\":\"import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: design tutorial environment --\x3e\\n\\n# Designing with PX Blue\\n\\nUsing the PX Blue design system as a designer can greatly improve your efficiency and the quality of your products.

It's much easier to scale designs up than to scale them down. We also strongly encourage you to perform extensive user research to truly understand your users and their needs, skills, preferences, and tendencies.\\n\\n## Web Applications\\n\\nKeep the interface simple - avoid unnecessary elements and ensure the language used for labels and messaging is clear.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nStrive for consistency by using pre-defined PX Blue UI elements where possible. By using these elements, your users will feel more familiar and will be able to get things done quickly. You can also help ensure consistency by defining patterns in language, layout, and design that are used throughout the application.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nBe purposeful when laying out page content. Consider space and the relationship between items on the page. Structure pages based on importance.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nUse the typography guidelines to create hierarchy and clarity. An effective type hierarchy increases scalability, legibility, and readability.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nEnsure that the application provides effective feedback to users. Make sure that you communicate location, actions, changes in state, and errors to users. PX Blue has various UI elements to assist with communicating this information.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nConsider using defaults. If you have a strong understanding of the users of your application, careful planning around default states, actions, and paths can reduce the burden on your users.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\n## Mobile Applications\\n\\nGenerally, interfaces less than seven inches in width should be treated as a mobile (phone) device. Font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices as much as possible - your product should feel like the same application regardless of the device used to access it. When working with a dedicated mobile app, familiarize yourself with device / platform capabilities and take advantage of these where possible.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nA fundamental principle for mobile design is to include only the information that is necessary. Don't overload the user with excessive information. Mobile devices are a convenient way to quickly consume information on the go and the information presented should reflect this.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nInterfaces greater than seven inches in width should be treated as a tablet device. As with phone devices, font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices in this class. However, you may find it appropriate to have some differences between phone and tablet devices because of the difference in screen real estate.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nTablet designs should look and feel like a desktop application / website, but they should function like a phone app.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\nAs technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider scaling for the future. Products such as non-mobile touch screens, interactive displays, automotive displays, and touch screen laptops should be considered during your design phase.\\n\\n\x3c!--image--\x3e\\n\\n<Divider style={{}} />\\n\\n# Contributing\\n\\nWe encourage everyone to provide feedback, new design concepts, patterns, suggestions, or other ideas to help us create the most useful design system for our community.

When communicating with other members of the PX Blue community, you should strive to use this terminology to promote effective collaboration and understanding. This is applicable to designers, developers, product managers, etc.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[CategoriesImg]} regularWidth caption={'The four levels of the PX Blue design system hierarchy.'} />\\n\\n## Foundations\\n\\nThe foundations include the most basic visual elements on the page, such as [color](/style/color), [icons](/style/iconography), [typography](/style/typography), etc. These typically have no behavior or interaction on their own, but instead are used to communicate information to a user, establish a brand, or lay the foundations for the PX Blue components, pages, and workflows.\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nComponents are the basic functional units of the UI. They are usually interactive through clicking, expanding, etc. Components can be as simple (such as buttons, tabs, sliders) or complex (such as [navigation drawers](/patterns/navigation)). Simpler components are often combined to form complex ones.\\n\\nMost of the simple components in PX Blue are defined and built by Material Design and the component libraries that implement it. PX Blue focuses on defining and building advanced components that are shared across PX Blue applications.\\n\\n## Pages\\n\\nPages are the largest single unit in the PX Blue design system. These are typically full-screen designs that specify how certain pages can look in an application. Foundation of these pages should stay the same while there may be some room for customizations. Examples of pages include \\\"login (empty fields)\\\" and \\\"create password (invalid)\\\".\\n\\n## Workflows\\n\\nWorkflows are a sequence of pages combined with rules surrounding how a user goes from one page to another. These usually represent a common path that a user is expected to take to complete various tasks. Workflows that are defined in PX Blue are intended to be nearly identical between applications. Examples of very common workflows include the [login](/patterns/user-auth) experience and user registration / sign up.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Design Patterns\\n\\n<RegularWidth>\\n    <ImageGrid images={[PatternStatesImg]} regularWidth />\\n</RegularWidth>\\n\\n[Design patterns](/patterns) are very common in PX Blue. A design pattern is a common interaction or behavior that can exist at any level in the design system hierarchy described above. For example, we may have a design pattern for showing actions available on a list item or how to interact with individual settings on a settings page.\\n\\nBecause a design pattern centers around interactions, they typically include different states. A button can be normal, hovered, or pressed. Similarly, a login workflow can involve login with 2FA, Captcha, or simply a username and password.\\n\\nFor each state, PX Blue tries to provide:\\n\\n-   Guidelines: How it's used and in what context\\n-   Design Specifications: How it looks\\n-   Interactions: How it goes from one state to another\\n-   Code: How it can be implemented\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# PX Blue and the Atomic Design System\\n\\nIf you are familiar with other design systems, such as the [Atomic Design System](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), you may recognize some concepts used here. PX Blue's \\\"components\\\" parallel Atomic Design's atoms, molecules, and organisms. The idea of \\\"pages\\\" is the same in both systems, but PX Blue also goes one level further in each direction (i.e., Foundations and Workflows) to define a project's user experience more comprehensively.\\n\"},\"/design/accessibility\":{\"title\":\"Accessibility\",\"text\":\"import { MaterialDesignDescription, Divider, ImageGrid } from '../../app/components';\\nimport { Link as LinkIcon } from '@material-ui/icons';\\nimport AccessibilityDesignImg from '../../app/assets/design/design-color.png';\\nimport PerceivableDesignImg from '../../app/assets/design/design-perceivable.png';\\nimport UnderstandableDesignImg from '../../app/assets/design/design-understandable.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: accessibility design styles compliance w3c  --\x3e\\n\\n# Accessibility\\n\\nAccessibility for the web refers to designing your websites and applications so that individuals with disabilities are able to use them effectively. Disabilities can come in many forms including visual, physical, auditory, etc. It is important to design your applications to be accessible, both to reach as wide an audience as possible and for potential legal reasons. Making your application accessible improves the user experience for individuals without disabilities as well.\\n\\n> For international products it is important to research what level of compliance is required by law \u2014 accessibility requirements vary from one country to another.\\n\\nThe best practice guidelines used internationally for making websites accessible are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG) 2.0, released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2008.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Four Principles of Accessibility\\n\\nThere are four principles that lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use web content \u2014 Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.\\n\\n## Perceivable\\n\\nInformation and user interface components must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. For example, a button should look like a button and not be hidden behind an image or other hard-to-distinguish elements.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[PerceivableDesignImg]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: The proper way to display a color picker on mobile.',\\n        '2: An incorrect way to display a color picker on mobile. The color swatches do not look like buttons and clickable areas are too small.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n## Operable\\n\\nOperable means that users must be able to perform the actions required to interact with interface elements. This means that all functionality should be available via the keyboard (including navigation), temporary content should be displayed long enough to be read by individuals with visual impairments, etc.\\n\\n## Understandable\\n\\nUsers must be able to consume information and interact with the application easily. This includes using appropriate language (avoiding abbreviations, writing at an appropriate reading level, etc.), making sure that interface elements behave in consistent and predictable ways, providing helpful error messages and instructions, etc.\\n\\nFor example, accompanying a button with a text label makes it more understandable if the meaning of the icon on its own is unclear.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[UnderstandableDesignImg]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: The correct way to display an action for a card.

It is not immediately clear that the card is clickable or that there is any way to see more content',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n## Robust\\n\\nWeb content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users, including those who rely on assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, text-to-speech software, alternative pointing devices, etc.). As assistive technologies advance, your applications will need to account for these advances.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Color\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[AccessibilityDesignImg]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: An acceptable level of color contrast.

Remember that icons should also be checked for at least AA compliance.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nPX Blue colors and components have been tested to meet minimum accessibility requirements. By using these default styles, you should be able to reduce the effort required for your product to pass accessibility tests.\\n\\nIf your project requires the use of additional styles or colors, you should adhere to the following guidelines:\\n\\n-   Use PX Blue colors in the 500+ range for white backgrounds.\\n-   Avoid using yellow, red, and orange for text (except for single-line error messages on forms)\\n-   Do not rely on colors for instructions (e.g., do not say \\\"Click the red button to close\\\")\\n\\nMost PX Blue text elements use the Black 500 color, with some headlines using Blue 500. Button labels should use White 50 for dark background and Black 500 on light backgrounds.

However, it can also be adapted for use in traditional web sites as well.\\n\\n<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[WebsiteDesign]} caption={[`Photo by William Iven on Unsplash`]} />\\n\\n## Websites vs. Applications\\n\\nThe line between websites and web applications is often blurry. In general, websites primarily provide information in a read-only format for the purposes of education, promotion, marketing, etc.\\n\\nA web application is typically more interactive and provides users the ability to affect the data in the application (e.g., adding items, deleting items, etc.). These applications are typically built to serve a particular use case or function that users need to perform frequently.\\n\\nWebsites:\\n\\n-   Static content\\n-   Usually publicly accessible\\n-   Read-only visual & text content\\n-   Less interactive / functional compared to web applications\\n\\nApplications:\\n\\n-   Dynamic content\\n-   Often incorporates user accounts / authentication\\n-   Users can manipulate data\\n-   More interactive / functional compared to a website\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[Website, WebApp]}\\n    caption={[\\n        `Websites typically present read-only information to users, whereas web applications are more interactive and allow users to change the underlying data.`,\\n        `Photos by Domenico Loia and Carlos Muza on Unsplash`,\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Principles of Website Design\\n\\nThere are several key principles for effective website design. Many of these principles can also be considered when designing a web application, with some notable differences called out below.\\n\\n## Beauty & Simplicity\\n\\nHow your website looks is important, but it's not the reason users are coming to your site \u2014 typically they are looking for some particular piece of information. However, users _will_ notice a bad design, so making sure your website is visually appealing is still crucial.\\n\\nKeeping your designs simple is a way to strike balance. You should avoid unnecessary design elements (i.e., don't design for the sake of design) \u2014 this will only serve to overwhelm users and make it more difficult for them to find what they are looking for. A clean and simple design helps the audience focus on the value of the brand and on your content. Often, users will associate a website design with the quality of a particular company or product.\\n\\n> Using whitespace liberally can help maintain a simplistic design and also improve readability.\\n\\n## Effective Navigation\\n\\nUsers are typically coming to your website to find information, so you should make your website as easy to navigate as possible to maximize their chance of finding what they need. User should be able to land on your site and immediately identify where they need to go.\\n\\n-   Primary navigation should be simple and located at the top of every page\\n-   Include additional navigation or a site map in the footer of your website\\n-   Consider adding breadcrumbs so users can quickly see where they are.\\n    -   If you use breadcrumbs, they should be used on every page.\\n-   Include a search functionality so users can quickly find what they are looking for\\n-   Limit the number of navigation options (e.g., tabs, breadcrumbs, menus, etc.) per page\\n-   Limit the nesting of information where possible.\\n    -   Try to keep your website to no more than three levels deep (use a pyramid structure to organize your content).\\n\\n## Layout & Hierarchy\\n\\nWhere and how content is presented is a critical aspect of website design. You should arrange the elements on each page so that the user will naturally gravitate to the most important elements first. Your goal should be to facilitate users' actions in a way that feels intuitive, natural, and enjoyable. You can draw your users to certain elements on the page by utilizing a combination of position, size, and color.\\n\\nYour website should be designed on a [grid system](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/) to help tie elements together and promote responsiveness for different sized screens.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[Grid]} regularWidth caption={`Photo by Thomas Bredin-Grey`} />\\n\\n## Colors\\n\\nColor can be very powerful when it is used effectively. You should keep colors to a minimum to maximize the effect in the areas where they are used. We recommend using no more than five different colors in your website designs (ideally shades of blue, black, gray, and white from the PX Blue [palette](/style/color)). For product catalogs or commerce sites, you should absolutely use the product's branding color(s) on your site.\\n\\nYou should focus your use of color on image backgrounds, highlight colors, etc.\\n\\n## Typography\\n\\nIn general, websites following the PX Blue design language should use the Open Sans font. If you require an alternative, you should ensure that any font you use is highly legible at all sizes.\\n\\n-   Avoid using script fonts\\n-   Minimize the use of colored text and make sure it contrasts with the background color.\\n-   Use no more than three different typefaces.\\n-   Use no more than three different font sizes.\\n-   Keep body copy and label font sizes at 12px or larger\\n    -   Do not use any text smaller than 8px\\n\\nYou can read more about typography in the [Typography](/style/typography) guide.\\n\\n## Graphics\\n\\nGraphics are most powerful when used sparingly. Only use graphics if they help the user complete a specific task or if they showcase a specific product / situation. You can read more about graphics in our [Illustrations](/style/illustrations) guide.\\n\\n## Consistency\\n\\nThe overall look and feel of your site should be consistent across pages. Backgrounds, colors, typefaces and the tone of writing are all areas where consistency has a positive impact on usability.\\n\\nConsistency does not mean every page should look identical. Try to define different layouts for specific types of pages (e.g., landing page, information page, product page, etc.). Use these layouts consistently throughout your website.\\n\\nIn addition to visual consistency, it is also important to maintain a consistent tone throughout the website. Your content should be written using the same voice throughout the website. Content should be descriptive and straight to the point \u2014 keep technical jargon to a minimum.\\n\\n## Responsiveness\\n\\nYour website should be functional across a wide range of different devices, including desktop computers, mobile phones, and tablets. Nearly 50% of all web traffic comes from mobile and tablet devices, so you should strive to follow a [mobile-first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00) design strategy. PX Blue is working to develop website grid templates for traditional website design in Figma. You can refer to [Material designs Responsive layout](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html) grid for more detailed information.\\n\\n<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[ResponsiveDesignImg]} caption={[`Photo by Vincent Xia`]} />\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nThe audience for a website can be even more diverse than for a web application. Your website should be accessible to all potential users. As with any Eaton digital product it is important to refer to the [Accessibility](/design/accessibility) guide for more detailed information. The main principles still apply to website design.\\n\\n## Conventions\\n\\nThere are a number of conventions that users have come to expect from websites. You should strive to follow these conventions when possible:\\n\\n-   Placing the main navigation at the top left or on the side of the site\\n-   Placing a product logo at the top left of the site\\n    -   The logo should be clickable and take the user back to the home page\\n-   Links and buttons should change color / appearance when hovered over\\n-   Ensuring image galleries / slideshows have buttons for users to manually rotate slides\\n-   Use shopping cart icons on a commerce site.\\n    -   Include a badge that indicates the number of items in the cart.\\n\\n\x3c!--# Key Differences vs. Web Application--\x3e\\n\"},\"/patterns\":{\"title\":\"Design Patterns\"},\"/patterns/appbar\":{\"title\":\"App Bars\",\"text\":\"import { DemoCard, ImageGrid, MaterialDesignDescription, Divider } from '../../app/components';\\nimport Banner from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/appbar-banner.png';\\nimport Collapsible from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/collapsible-appbar/collapsible.gif';\\nimport Search from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/search.gif';\\nimport MiniSearch from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/mini-search.png';\\nimport SiteSearch from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/site-search.png';\\nimport PageSearch from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/page-search.png';\\nimport ComponentSearch from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/component-search.png';\\nimport Collapsed from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/collapsible-appbar/collapsed.png';\\nimport AutoVariants from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/search-bar/auto-complete-variants.png';\\nimport BasicBars from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/basic-app-bars.png';\\nimport DropdownVariations from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/dropdown-toolbar-variations.png';\\nimport Specs1Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/specs-1.png';\\nimport Specs3Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/specs-3.png';\\nimport Specs4Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/app-bar/specs-4.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: design pattern appbar search collapse toolbar banner --\x3e\\n\\n# App Bars\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[Banner]} regularWidth />\\n\\nApp bars, sometimes called toolbars, are often one of the first elements you see in an application.

Typically, this is a short title that indicates which screen the user is on (e.g., \\\"Settings\\\"). However, the app bar can also contain a navigation icon, subtitle, and/or various global action buttons for the screen. When placing actions in the app bar, limit yourself to no more than three.

In these cases, you can use a collapsible app bar that starts out tall but will shrink as the user scrolls down the page until it becomes a basic app bar. This allows you the flexibility to present an eye-catching banner without permanently reducing the amount of usable space on the page. This is a pattern most commonly used for mobile applications, but could also be used for web.\\n\\nThe collapsible appbar should transition smoothly between the expanded and collapsed states \u2014 this means you will need to account for how the app bar will look throughout the transition.

This mode of search is achieved by placing a search icon/button in the primary app bar. When this button is clicked, a white search bar slides in from the right to cover the default app bar. As the user enters text into the search field, the data is filtered in real-time. A back icon will close the Search Bar and clear the search results.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[Search]}\\n    caption={'When the search icon is clicked, a white search bar will slide in and cover the default tool bar. '}\\n/>\\n\\n## Auto-complete\\n\\nFor more advanced searching, you may wish to include an auto-complete feature. You can implement autocomplete by including a contextual menu below the search bar with suggested search items. Alternatively, you can use type-ahead to automatically update the recommended search query in the search field as the user types (Google search does this).\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        regularWidth\\n        images={[AutoVariants]}\\n        caption={[\\n            '1.

One of the most important parts of working with forms is properly validating the information that users enter into them. In general, PX Blue follows the form behaviors explained in detail by Material Design.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'Text Fields'} url={`https://material.io/components/text-fields/`} />\\n    <DemoCard\\n        repository={'form-validation'}\\n        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fform-validation%2Fform-validation.component.ts`}\\n        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/form-validation/index.tsx&initialpath=form-validation`}\\n    />\\n    <Divider />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n# Anatomy\\n\\n## Form Layout\\n\\nKeep your forms short where possible, but make effective use of whitespace to avoid overwhelming your users. If your forms are larger than the height of your target device, consider breaking them into sections or multiple pages to improve the user experience.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[LongFormImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={\\n        'You can either split the forms into sections with dividers (#1) or into multiple pages with steppers (#2), or a combination of both.'\\n    }\\n/>\\n\\n\x3c!--\\n## Input Controls\\n\\nWhen using multiple input controls, such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, try to keep all of your inputs in a single column to preserve the sense of a linear progression. Inputs should be approximately as wide as their expected input values (or full width on mobile). Follow the Material Design [guidelines](https://material.io/components/selection-controls#specs) for when to use different selection controls.\\n --\x3e\\n\\n## Field Requirements\\n\\nRequired / optional fields should be identified according to the Material Design guidelines. If your form fields have complex requirements for valid values, you can list these criteria below the input. A common use case for this is when displaying password complexity requirements.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[Image4, Image5, Image6]} caption={'A common application of form validation \u2014 reset password.'} />\\n\\n## Error Messages\\n\\nIf there is an error with the data entered into a field, the field should indicate to the user that there is a problem. Label and helper text should be changed to a red color and the error message should be displayed in the helper text location below the field \u2014 any existing helper text should be replaced with the error message. You may optionally show an additional error icon in the text input.\\n\\nError messages should be succinct and should not provide information that could compromise security (e.g., use \\\"Invalid Credentials\\\" instead of \\\"Incorrect Password\\\").\\n\\n## Success Screens\\n\\nOnce a user has reached the end of a form successfully, you should present them with a success screen. This screen should indicate to the user that their submission was accepted and offer information about the next steps (e.g., \\\"Click the finish button below to log in.\\\"). Typically these success screens are stylized for your application and will include some bold graphics or [illustrations](/style/illustrations).\\n\\n## Mobile Keyboard\\n\\nMobile devices offer multiple different software keyboard variations for different types of inputs. Make sure that you are using the appropriate keyboard for your inputs (e.g., use the email keyboard for email inputs, phone number keyboard for a phone number field, etc.).\\n\\nTypically, mobile devices also allow you to change the label on the return key of the software keyboard. This label should be appropriate to the context (see [Submitting the Form](/patterns/forms#submitting-the-form) below).\\n\\nThe focused input field should remain centered in the screen when the software keyboard is open \u2014 it should not be hidden behind the keyboard.\\n\\n## Password Visibility\\n\\nDepending on the security requirements of your application, it may be useful to add a password visibility toggle button to fields where users must enter a password (such as during login or changing a password). The visibility toggle switches the input type between hidden text and plain text so users can ensure that they typed their password correctly.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Behaviors\\n\\n## Verifying User Input\\n\\nIn general, there are three acceptable times to perform form field verification:\\n\\n-   on blur: the field is verified when the user clicks away from it\\n-   on change: the field is dynamically verified on each keystroke or change in the value\\n-   on action: fields are verified after performing a specific action, such as clicking a button\\n\\n### Verifying on Blur\\n\\nIn order to avoid distracting or confusing users, most text fields should verify input when the field loses focus. Error messages should not appear until the user is finished entering data and the field is no longer in focus.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[OnBlurImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: Do not check for validity or display error messages when the user is typing in the field.',\\n        '2: The user is finished and the input has lost focus (i.e., \\\"blurred\\\"). Now the input should be verified.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n### Verifying on Change\\n\\nSome fields should verify the user input as it changes. The most common case for this type of verification is a new password field or a confirm password field. The verification feedback should be displayed / updated each time the user makes a change to the input field.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[OnChangeImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: The password criteria checks shall be updated as the user changes their input.',\\n        '2: \u201cConfirm Password\u201d field should check for a match with password to give immediate feedback for when the user can proceed.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n### Verifying on Action\\n\\nIn some specific situations, you may need to defer verification or perform it for all fields in a form at once. In this case, you need to link verification to a specific action, such as clicking a button.\\n\\nThis type of verification is common when the checks cannot be performed on the client, such as making an API call to verify a registration code, check user login credentials, or search for a device on the network. In most cases, you can do some preliminary checks using one of the two methods above (e.g., you can check if the email is a valid email before making the API call to verify the credentials).\\n\\nIf verification is being triggered by clicking on a button, you should replace the button text with a loading spinner while the verification is in progress. If the verification is successful, the user should be automatically taken to the next screen.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[OnPageChangeImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',\\n        '1: The helper text will be replaced by the error message. ',\\n        '2: Use a circular progress indicator when waiting for responses from the server.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n## Submitting the Form\\n\\nForms should have a button to submit the data or continue to the next part of the form if there are multiple parts. Depending on what happens next, the button should be labeled _Next_, _Finish_, or similar. The button should be located at the bottom right corner of the form (bottom left for right-to-left languages).\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[SubmitButtonLocationImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: On desktops, the button is placed in the bottom corner of the form.',\\n        '2: On mobile, the software keyboard has different options for the action button',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nOn mobile, if there are multiple input fields on the screen, the keyboard action button should say \\\"next\\\", unless you are on the last item of the page, in which case the keyboard button should say \\\"done\\\" or \\\"submit\\\". This button can either submit the form or simply dismiss the keyboard (if you want users to have a chance to review their information first).\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[NextButtonUsageImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        ,\\n        '1: The user entered a valid input. Clicking \\\"next\\\" will auto-focus the user to the next text field.',\\n        '2: The user entered an invalid input. Clicking \\\"next\\\" will display the error message but will not auto-focus to the next text field.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nFor screens where there is a single field with a known required length (e.g., a verification code), the submit button can be omitted and the form submitted as soon as the required length is reached.\\n\\n\x3c!-- TODO: A gif might handle the task better here --\x3e\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[SubmitButtonAutoSubmitImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={\\n        'For the verification code screen, you can auto-submit the information once the user input reaches the required length (#2). After the verification code is recognized (#3), the screen pauses for a short moment before automatically moving to the next screen.'\\n    }\\n/>\\n\\n### Disabling the Submit Button\\n\\nIf there are errors indicated on any of the form fields, the submit button should be disabled. If you are performing verification when clicking the submit button (onAction), all the invalid fields should be indicated if they aren't already.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    {/* <ImageGrid\\n        images={[SubmitButtonOnChangeImage]}\\n        regularWidth\\n        caption={\\n            'When your input field field is verified on change, disable the submit button until the user enters a valid input.'\\n        }\\n    /> */}\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[SubmitButtonOnBlurImage]}\\n        regularWidth\\n        caption={'The submit button is disabled until the user has entered something for all the required fields.'}\\n    />\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[dismissKeyboardErrorAutoscrollImage, dismissKeyboardErrorTextImage]}\\n        caption={[\\n            '1: The UI should auto-scroll to and focus on the first invalid field.',\\n            '2: On login screens, form fields should not shift when errors appear.',\\n        ]}\\n    />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Design Specifications\\n\\nFor additional instructions, refer to Material Design's [specifications](https://material.io/components/text-fields#specs) for \\\"Text fields\\\".\\n\\n## Mobile\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs1Image, Specs2Image, Specs3Image]} regularWidth />\\n\\n## Desktop and Tablet\\n\\nIf certain dimensions are not specified, refer to the dimensions suggested in the mobile section above.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs4Image, Specs5Image]} regularWidth />\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Developers\\n\\nUse the following components to implement this pattern:\\n\\n**Angular** \u2014 Angular Material\\n\\n-   [Form Field](https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview)\\n-   [Input](https://material.angular.io/components/input/overview)\\n\\n**React** \u2014 Material-UI\\n\\n-   [Text Field](https://material-ui.com/components/text-fields/#text-field)\\n\\n**React Native** \u2014 React-Native-Paper\\n\\n-   [TextInput](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/text-input.html)\\n\"},\"/patterns/internationalization\":{\"title\":\"Internationalization\",\"text\":\"import { DemoCard, ImageGrid, MaterialDesignDescription, Divider } from '../../app/components';\\nimport { Link as LinkIcon } from '@material-ui/icons';\\nimport InternationalizationImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/internationalization.svg';\\nimport IconsFlippedImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/icons-flipped.png';\\nimport UIFlippedImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/ui-flipped.png';\\nimport ButtonWidthImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/button-width.png';\\nimport TextFieldWidthImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/text-field-width.png';\\nimport LanguageOptionsImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/language-options.png';\\nimport CulturalDifferencesImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/cultural-differences.svg';\\nimport FormsImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/internationalization/forms.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: design pattern internationalization i18n internationalisation language translate translation localization l10n rtl localisation globalization globalize globalisation globalise --\x3e\\n\\n# Internationalization & Localization\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[InternationalizationImage]} regularWidth />\\n<DemoCard\\nrepository={'internationalization'}\\nangular={\\n`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fi18n%2Fi18n.component.ts`\\n}\\nreact={\\n`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/i18n/index.tsx&initialpath=i18n`\\n}\\n/>\\n\\nInternationalization and localization refer to a set of practices for adapting applications to different regions, languages, and cultures. You can accomplish this in your applications or websites by considering the differences in language, scripts, and directionality.\\n\\nInternationalization, sometimes abbreviated as \\\"I18N,\\\" refers to the process of designing products that are functionally independent of interfaces or interactions that rely on a specific language or cultural context. This process enables products or services to be equally experienced by people using any language or from any cultural background. Localization, sometimes written as \\\"L10N,\\\" concerns adapting or customizing a product to some specific areas. Internationalization and localization are both crucial in making your application prosper in a global market.\\n\\nYou should always consider Internationalization during the design process, especially if there is a vision for reaching our Global market. Understanding and capturing possible needs for localization should begin at the outset of any new product development, even if the short-term goal is focused on only one market.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Changing Locales\\n\\n<MaterialDesignDescription\\n    title={'Language Support'}\\n    url={`https://material.io/design/typography/language-support.html#language-considerations`}\\n/>\\n\\n## Translation\\n\\nTo localize your application content, you should create a string resource file or object that contains the translations for any display text used in your application. Do not have any text hard-coded in your application's UI. To switch your application to another language, you simply toggle the file/object used to populate the UI to the appropriate translation.\\n\\n## Showing Language Options\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[LanguageOptionsImage]} regularWidth />\\n\\nLanguage options are typically presented in the user preferences or settings section of an application. In the case where users do not require an account, such as on a public-facing website, the language option is expected in the app bar or in the footer. You should provide cues, such as an icon, to help users locate the language selection.\\n\\nWhen showing a list of languages, the language names should be presented in their own language (i.e., use \\\"Espa\xf1ol\\\", not \\\"Spanish\\\").\\n\\n## Converting Units, Currencies, and Formats\\n\\nUnits, currency, and formats are usually linked with a particular locale. However, there can be differences in usage even within a single locale. You should provide users with the option to change these values (if appropriate for your application) in their locale settings.\\n\\nSome commonly influenced formats include:\\n\\n-   Phone number\\n-   Names (e.g., given name vs. surname order)\\n-   Address (e.g., street name first or country name first)\\n-   Date and time\\n-   Numbers (comma vs. period)\\n-   Punctuation\\n\\nConsider your global audience when crafting forms \u2014 you may need to support multiple input formats such as for a phone number.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[FormsImage]} caption={'Allow the users to put in an international phone number.'} regularWidth />\\n\\n## Checking for Layout\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[ButtonWidthImage, TextFieldWidthImage]}\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: Buttons with different width.',\\n        '2: Error message in English.',\\n        '3: Same error message in Malayalam can result in line wrapping.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nDifferent languages or writing systems may require different vertical and horizontal space. To ensure flexibility, avoid using fixed dimensions for UI components such as buttons, labels, and badges. Also, consider setting different default display font sizes for languages that may have smaller glyphs.\\n\\n> **NOTE:** PX Blue recommends using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) for all non-western languages.

Applications supporting these languages will need to mirror the UI so the natural flow is from right to left. For example, navigation drawers should be displayed on the right side of the screen, icons should be to the right of the text in buttons, and [any icons with directionality](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements) should be mirrored.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[UIFlippedImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: A PX Blue user interface in right-to-left language (English).',\\n        '2: The same PX Blue user interface in left-to-right language (Arabic).',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[IconsFlippedImage]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: Icons that indicate directions should be mirrored.',\\n        '2: Icons with glyphs and symbols should never be mirrored.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n<MaterialDesignDescription\\n    title={'Which icons should be mirrored for RTL?'}\\n    description={'A list of Material icons that should be mirrored in a RTL UI.'}\\n    url={`http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#which-icons-should-be-mirrored-for-rtl-`}\\n    avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n/>\\n\\n## Cultural Differences\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[CulturalDifferencesImage]} regularWidth />\\n\\nAddressing cultural differences is the key concern of localization. Sometimes certain UI elements convey different meaning in different cultures. For example, in America, the red color in the stock market indicates a decline, while in China the same color indicates a rise. A thumbs-up gesture usually expresses an approval in English-speaking country, yet the gesture can have a negative meaning in Iraq. When designing for a new market, you are encouraged to have a local consultant run an audit for your application.\\n\\nWhen you are designing for webpages, instead of applications, your primary goal is to advertise your products and services, and appeal to the local market. The language tone, page style, and choice of image assets are expected to be tailored for different targeted culture. Likewise, your user study and market research conclusions derived under a certain cultural background might not apply to another culture.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\\n        title={'Design Localization and the New Web'}\\n        description={'An examination of localization in web design by Bitmatica Lab.'}\\n        url={`https://medium.com/bitmatica-lab/design-localization-and-the-new-web-f54f43c5f040`}\\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n    />\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\\n        title={'Localization'}\\n        url={`https://developer.apple.com/localization/`}\\n        description={`Apple's suggestions on designing for an international market.`}\\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n    />\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\\n        title={'Localization - Market Finder'}\\n        description={'Introduction to localization by Google Market Finder.'}\\n        url={`https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en_us/topic/localisation/`}\\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n    />\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\\n        title={'Internationalization and Localization'}\\n        description={'A checklist from Wikipedia.'}\\n        url={`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Scope`}\\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n    />\\n    <Divider />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n# Developers\\n\\nThere are a number of available libraries to assist with implementing internationalization in your applications.\\n\\n## Angular and Ionic\\n\\nFor projects that need the ability to swap between languages, we recommend using [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). As an alternative, the Angular framework has a powerful built-in [i18n tool](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) available, but it requires a separate web app be built for each supported language (e.g. an English version, a Spanish version, etc). This is ideal for larger projects that don't require in-app language switching and don't support more than a few locales.\\n\\n## React\\n\\nThere are many JS libraries available to help internationalize your applications. We recommend using [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) to manage your translations. If you are supporting right-to-left languages, you should also carefully follow the guide from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/guides/right-to-left).\\n\\n## React Native\\n\\nAs with React for web, we recommend using [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) to manage your translations. If you are supporting right-to-left languages, you can make use of the [I18nManager](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps) from React Native.\\n\"},\"/patterns/lists\":{\"title\":\"Lists & Tables\",\"text\":\"import { DemoCard, ImageGrid, MaterialDesignDescription, Divider } from '../../app/components';\\n\\nimport ListBannerImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/lists.svg';\\n\\n\x3c!-- Common Use Cases --\x3e\\n\\nimport DashboardListImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/dashboard-list.png';\\nimport NotificationListDesktopImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/notification-list-desktop.png';\\nimport AnatomyImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/anatomy.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- Variations --\x3e\\n\\nimport SimpleListImage1 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/simple-list-1.png';\\nimport SimpleListImage2 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/simple-list-2.png';\\nimport StatusListImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/status-list.png';\\nimport ScorecardImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/scorecard.png';\\nimport ContactsImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/contacts.png';\\nimport IconAlignImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/icon-align.png';\\nimport NotificationBucketsImage1 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/notification-buckets-1.png';\\nimport NotificationBucketsImage2 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/notification-buckets-2.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- Behaviors --\x3e\\n\\nimport NotificationListMobileImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/notification-list-mobile.png';\\nimport DashboardListDesktopImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/dashboard-list-desktop.png';\\nimport DashboardListMobileImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/dashboard-list-mobile.png';\\nimport GlobalActionAppBarImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/action-button-in-appbar.png';\\nimport GlobalActionPanelHeaderImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/action-button-in-panel-header.png';\\nimport GlobalActionAsButtonImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/action-button-as-button.png';\\nimport SortableListImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/sortable-list.gif';\\nimport LocalListActionsImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/local-list-actions.png';\\nimport MultiSelectImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/multi-select-list.png';\\nimport NavigateListImage1 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/navigate-list-1.png';\\nimport NavigateListImage2 from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/navigate-list-2.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- Specs --\x3e\\n\\nimport Spec1Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-1.png';\\nimport Spec2Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-2.png';\\nimport Spec3Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-3.png';\\nimport Spec4Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-4.png';\\nimport Spec5Image from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-5.png';\\nimport SpecTypographyImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/lists/spec-typography.png';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: design pattern list status sort table drag drop action data --\x3e\\n\\n# Lists & Tables\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[ListBannerImage]} regularWidth />\\n\\nLists and tables are frequently used throughout PX Blue applications.

The buttons typically sit in an [Appbar](/patterns/appbar), a panel header, or a button panel (desktop-only).\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[GlobalActionAppBarImage, GlobalActionPanelHeaderImage, GlobalActionAsButtonImage]}\\n    caption={[\\n        `1: Global actions in the Appbar.`,\\n        '2: Global actions in the panel header.',\\n        '3: Global actions in its own button panel.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nCommon global list actions include:\\n\\n-   Adding a new list item\\n-   Sorting and filtering the list\\n-   Toggling a different view, such as a grid view\\n-   Exporting or downloading the list data\\n\\n### Drag and Drop\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[SortableListImage]} regularWidth />\\n<DemoCard repository={'sortable-list'}\\nangular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fsortable-list%2Fsortable-list.component.ts`}\\nreact={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/sortable-list/index.tsx&initialpath=sortable-list`}\\nionic={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/ionic-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fsortable-list%2Fsortable-list.component.ts`}\\nreactNative\\n/>\\n\\nDrag and drop is a special case for list sorting. It re-orders the items in a list manually. This should be accomplished by placing a drag handle as the leftmost element in the row, and pushing all the list item content to its right. In most cases, the ability to re-order the list should be locked behind an Edit Mode toggle mechanism.\\n\\n## Local List Item Actions\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[LocalListActionsImage]}\\n    caption={[\\n        '1: A 3-dot icon, used to open a menu for more list actions.',\\n        '2: A chevron, usually indicates the entire list item is clickable and opens up a new page with list item details.',\\n        '3: A few icons that serve as list action buttons.',\\n        '4: An inline checkbox to toggle a status.',\\n        '5: An inline text field for data entry.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\nIf there are actions that you need to perform on individual list items, you may add icon buttons or an action menu. If you have three or fewer actions, they can be represented by individual icon buttons. If there are more than three, you should move them into an action menu.\\n\\n> If your entire list item is clickable, you should not include local list actions, as the two interactions can interfere with one another.\\n\\n### Navigating Down a Tree Structure\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[NavigateListImage1, NavigateListImage2]}\\n    caption={['1: A list used for separated pages.', '2: A list displaying a folder structure.']}\\n/>\\n\\nLists can be used to navigate a tree-like structure in an application.

Different variations are appropriate in different situations.\\n\\n## Placeholder Shapes\\n\\nWhen loading data for the first time, you do not want to show an empty screen while you are fetching the data. Instead, you should show placeholders that mimic (using simple shapes) the data that will eventually be loaded. This will give the impression that your application is faster and gives users an indication of what kind of data is being loaded.\\n\\nThe placeholder should match as closely as possible the real structure of the data. For example, if you are loading a list where each item has an icon, two lines of text, and an action button, then your placeholder should have a circle, two rectangles for the text, and another rectangle for the button. You should show as many placeholder elements as necessary to fill the area in the application that is loading data. You will want to apply an animation on the placeholder shapes to give a sense of progress.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[LoadingMobile, LoadedModal]}\\n        caption={'When data is loading, use placeholder shapes for where the data will appear.'}\\n    />\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        regularWidth\\n        images={[DesktopLoading]}\\n        caption={'Show a transition on the placeholder shapes to indicate progress.'}\\n    />\\n    <DemoCard\\n        repository={'loading-states'}\\n        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-states%2Floading-states.component.ts`}\\n        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-states/index.tsx&initialpath=loading-states`}\\n        ionic={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/ionic-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-states%2Floading-states.component.ts`}\\n        reactNative\\n    />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n## Spinner Overlays\\n\\nSpinner overlays make use of a semi-transparent overlay with a large, centered spinner.

The most common application of contextual spinners is during [Form](/patterns/forms) submission / verification. If you need to wait for a server response to validate inputs in a form (after clicking the submit button), you should disable the submit button and replace its label with a spinner. If the verification succeeds, the application should proceed to the next screen. If verification fails, the appropriate error messages should be displayed and the submit button label restored.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[InlineSpinner]}\\n    regularWidth\\n    caption={[\\n        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',\\n        '1: The helper text will be replaced by the error message. ',\\n        '2: Use a circular progress indicator when waiting for responses from the server.',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n## Progress Bars\\n\\nProgress bars should be used sparingly in your application. They should only be used in situations where progress is discrete / measurable. For example, it could be used to indicate progress when uploading a file to a server.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Behavior\\n\\n## Real-time Data (Polling / Pub-Sub)\\n\\nIf you are showing real-time data (either via polling or a push mechanism from the server), there is no need to show loading indicators. If you wish, you can display a small indicator when data is being refreshed or mention somewhere on the screen when the data was last refreshed so users can identify if the data is stale. You should avoid showing a loading indicator if your data is refreshed more than once per minute.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    regularWidth\\n    images={[MiniSpinner]}\\n    caption={'You can place a small loading icon in the header when data is updating.'}\\n/>\\n\\n## Manual Refresh\\n\\nIf your users can manually refresh data on the screen, you may wish to show the placeholder elements (as with initial load), or simply refresh the data behind the scenes without indication (as with real-time). Ultimately, this should depend on how long it takes to refresh the data - if it takes more than one second to load the data, you should use an indicator.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Design Specifications\\n\\nContext plays an important role in sizing your indicators. If you are using them in a small container, you may need to scale down from the recommended size.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        regularWidth\\n        images={[Specs]}\\n        caption={[\\n            '1.

Header', '2. Subheader', '3. Body', '4. Footer']}\\n    regularWidth\\n/>\\n\\nMost drawers have four main sections:\\n\\n-   **Header**: typically contains the name of the company, name of the product, or a logo\\n-   **Subheader**: an optional section that can be used to support custom content, such as filtering or search\\n-   **Body**: contains a list of primary pages that users can navigate to\\n-   **Footer**: usually contains the company logo, version number, and trademark information\\n\\nThere are several different styles of drawer navigation, each with slightly different behavior.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <DemoCard\\n        repository={'Drawer'}\\n        angular={`https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/components-drawer--within-a-drawer-layout`}\\n        react={`https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/story/components-drawer--in-drawer-layout`}\\n    />\\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\\n        title={'Navigation Drawer '}\\n        url={`https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer/`}\\n        style={{ marginRight: 0 }}\\n    />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n## Permanent\\n\\nA permanent drawer is always visible and always open. The permanent drawer is typically full-width, as opposed to the rail variant (see below). Use this variation if you have:\\n\\n-   five or more top-level pages\\n-   a nested navigation hierarchy\\n-   enough space to justify it (typically desktop-only applications)\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[NavigationPermanentImg]} caption={['A permanent drawer on desktop.']} regularWidth />\\n\\n## Rail\\n\\nA navigation rail is a permanently collapsed drawer. The rail shows less information than a standard drawer but has the advantage of a more compact, space-saving appearance. Use this variation if you have:\\n\\n-   fewer than seven top-level pages\\n-   a flat navigation hierarchy\\n-   limited space - recommended for HMI devices\\n\\nThe navigation rail can be regular (with text labels) or condensed (smaller area without labels).\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[NavigationRailImg]} \\ncaption={[\\n        'Condensed Rail on desktop.',\\n    ]}\\n    regularWidth \\n/>\\n<ImageGrid images={[NavigationRailLabelsImg]} \\ncaption={[\\n        'Standard rail with labels on desktop.',\\n    ]}\\n    regularWidth \\n/>\\n\\n## Persistent\\n\\nA persistent drawer is an always-visible drawer that can be opened and closed (expanded or collapsed). In its open state, it looks and behaves like a permanent drawer. In its closed state, it looks and behaves like a navigation rail. The drawer is typically opened and closed by clicking an icon in the header. It can also be opened momentarily on desktop applications by hovering with the mouse.

This variation of the drawer appears on top of the main navigation, typically using a dark overlay to block interaction with the main content. Use this variation if you have:\\n\\n-   a mobile application\\n-   extreme space limitations\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid images={[NavigationTemporaryImg]} caption={'Opened temporary drawer with overlay.'} regularWidth />\\n    <Divider />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n# Tab Navigation\\n\\nTab navigation uses a horizontal bar with buttons for each navigation location.

Bottom tabs are a quick and easy way to navigate to the most frequently used primary navigation routes.\\n\\nBottom tabs can also be used in combination with a drawer. The tabs are more prominent and can be used to highlight some main routes and features, while the drawer handles the less important routes like settings, legal documents, FAQ pages.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[NavigationBottomWithDrawerImg]}\\n        caption={[\\n            '1.

These appear as expandable panels in the drawer. When using hierarchical navigation in the drawer, you should try to limit yourself to no more than two levels.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[NestedItemImg]} caption={'Open and closed nested navigation.'} regularWidth />\\n\\n## Content-Cover vs. Content-Resize\\n\\nWhen a drawer is opened, there are two ways to deal with the main application content.\\n\\nWith content-resize, the main application content resizes its area to accommodate the expanded drawer. This is the default behavior for most drawer variations.\\n\\nWith content-cover, the navigation panel appears on top of the main application content, partially obscuring it. This typically uses a dark overlay behind the drawer to direct the user's focus to the navigation panel and block interaction with the main content. This pattern is most common when using the temporary drawer variant on mobile and tablet applications.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[ContentCoverImg]}\\n        caption={[\\n            '1.

Variations\\n\\nUser authentication contains four primary workflows:\\n\\n-   Registration\\n-   Joining an organization\\n-   Login\\n-   Forgot / Reset password\\n\\nAll of these workflows should follow the rules specified by our [forms and validation](/patterns/forms) pattern, and multi-step workflows should be connected using our [steppers](/patterns/steppers) pattern.\\n\\n<MaterialDesignDescription \\n    title={'Forms and Validation'}\\n    url={'/patterns/forms'}\\n    description={`Follow PX Blue's guideline for form controls.`}\\n

guideline for navigating between pages.`}\\n     avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\\n/>\\n\\nYour authentication and registration workflows should work equally well on different screen sizes. On mobile, these should be presented as full-screen layouts, whereas on desktop, they should be presented in a card centered on the screen as an [overlay](/patterns/overlay).\\n\\n## Registration\\n\\nRegistration is the process of user account creation. Typically, users can either register themselves (self-registration) or you can invite them to join your application (invitation-based).\\n\\n**Self-Registration**\\n\\nIf you do not need to restrict who can register for your application, you can allow users to self-register. The self-registration workflow includes the following steps:\\n\\n-   Enter email address\\n-   Accept EULA\\n-   Receive an email for verification\\n-   Verify email\\n-   Create password\\n-   Add account details\\n-   Success: account created\\n\\n**Registration via Invitation**\\n\\nIf you need to restrict who is able to use your application, you may choose to go with a invitation-based registration. In this situation, a system admin sends an email to authorized users inviting them to register. The invitation-based registration workflow includes the following steps:\\n\\n-   Receive an email for invitation\\n-   Accept EULA\\n-   Create password\\n-   Add account details\\n-   Success: account created\\n\\n### Screens\\n\\nThe majority of the registration screens are the same between invitation-based and self-registration. The primary difference is in how the registration workflow is initiated, and whether the email needs to be verified. Use the following screens for the registration workflow where appropriate.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[EnterEmailAdress, AcceptEULA, VerifyEmail, CreatePassword, AccountDetails, WelcomeOnboard]}\\n    caption={[\\n        'Screens in the registration workflow.',\\n        '1: Enter email address',\\n        '2: Accept EULA',\\n        '3: Verify email',\\n        '4: Create password',\\n        '5: Add account details',\\n        '6: Success: account created',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n\\n> The purpose of a success screen is to assure the user that something has been achieved. These screens can be an opportunity to perform more product branding \u2014 you are encouraged to use animations and [graphics](/style/illustrations) on these screens.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[RegistrationDesktop]}\\n    caption={'A registration screen example on desktop.'}\\n    regularWidth\\n    style={{ marginTop: '2em' }}\\n/>\\n\\n## Joining an Organization\\n\\nSome applications may require users to join specific groups or organizations after creating an account. Generally, there are three ways for a user to join an organization:\\n\\n**Request Access**\\n\\nThis occurs when a user has an account but need to access an invitation-only organization. This workflow involves the following steps:\\n\\n-   Enter organization identifier\\n-   Success: request sent\\n-   Receive an email invitation\\n-   Success: organization joined\\n\\n**Join with Invitation**\\n\\nJoining via invitation occurs when a system admin extends an invitation for a user to join a group. If the user does not yet have an account, they will first proceed through the invitation-based registration workflow followed by the screens for joining the organization. This workflow includes the following steps:\\n\\n-   Receive an email invitation\\n-   Success: organization joined\\n\\n### Screens\\n\\nThe majority of the joining-an-organization screens are the same regardless of the underlying mechanism. Use the following screens for the joining-an-organization workflow where appropriate.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[EnterOrganizationCode, EnterOrganizationConfirm, EnterOrganizationWelcome]}\\n    caption={[\\n        'Screens in the joining-an-organization workflow.',\\n        '1: Enter organization identifier',\\n        '2: Success: request sent',\\n        '3: Success: organization joined',\\n    ]}\\n/>\\n<ImageGrid images={[JoinAnOrganizationDesktop]} caption={'A join-an-organization screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\\n\\n## Login\\n\\n\x3c!--\\nAn NFC login might either be documented here, or wait until we start adding in device registery / discovery pattern\\n--\x3e\\n\\nLogging in can usually be accomplished in one of two ways: basic login or login via a third-party.\\n\\n**Basic Login**\\n\\nA simple login presents fields for the users to enter their credentials and a button to submit them for verification.\\n\\nThe login screen should always present information on how to create an account and what to do if a user has forgotten their credentials \u2014 these buttons should trigger the Registration and Forgot Password (see below) workflows .\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[Login]}\\n    caption={[\\n        'A standard login screen.',\\n        '1: Product identifications, such as product name or logo.',\\n        '2: You may also add a subtle background image with gradient to enhance the visual design and express the product brand.',\\n        '3: \\\"Remember me\\\" and \\\"password visibility\\\" are two features that improve user experience, but introduce potential security concerns.',\\n        '4: Login screens often include extra functions, such as \\\"forgot password\\\", \\\"sign up\\\", and \\\"contact your organization admin\\\".',\\n        '5: You may add certification badges and logos from partnerships here.',\\n    ]}\\n    gridImageProps={{ sm: 8 }}\\n/>\\n<ImageGrid images={[LoginDesktop]} caption={'A login screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\\n\\n**Login via Third Party**\\n\\nSome applications, especially consumer-facing ones, can be authorized via third-party accounts / credentials. Different platforms may have different requirements for this. Here are some commonly used platforms and their instructions:\\n\\n-   [Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/brand.html)\\n-   [Google Sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)\\n-   [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple/overview/introduction/)\\n-   [Facebook Login](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/)\\n-   [Sign in with Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/identity/add-sign-in-with-microsoft)\\n\\n## Forgot / Change Password\\n\\n**Forgot password**\\n\\nThe login screen for an application should also present users with a way to reset their password if they have forgotten it. This is typically displayed as a hyperlink below the credential fields. Clicking the link will present users with a field to enter their e-mail address. They will then receive an email with a hyperlink to reset their password. This workflow involves the following steps:\\n\\n-   Enter email address\\n-   Success: reset instructions sent\\n-   Receive an email for resetting the password\\n-   Create a new password\\n-   Success: password updated\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[ForgotPasswordEnterEmail, ForgotPasswordConfirmSent, ForgotPasswordNewPassword, ForgotPasswordWelcome]}\\n    caption={['1: Enter email address', '2: Success: reset instructions sent', '3: Create a new assword', '4: Success: password reset']}\\n/>\\n<ImageGrid images={[ResetPasswordDesktop]} caption={'A reset-password screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\\n\\n**Change Password**\\n\\nWhen the users are logged in, they have the option to change their password by going through the change password workflow, typically triggered from within the user settings. This workflow includes the following steps:\\n\\n-   Change password\\n-   Success: password updated\\n\\n> After a successful password change, users should be logged out and forced to log in with the new credentials.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid\\n        images={[ChangePassword, ChangePasswordWelcome]}\\n        caption={['1: Change password', '2: Success: password changed']}\\n    />\\n    <ImageGrid images={[ChangePasswordDesktop]} caption={'A change-password screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\\n    <Divider />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n# Behavior\\n\\n## Email Communications\\n\\n\x3c!-- This might deserve its own pattern. We already have something in the backlog to design for an email template. --\x3e\\n\\nEmail communications are frequently used throughout the user authentication workflow to verify the user's identity. Users receive emails for invitations, address verification, confirmation codes, etc.\\n\\nEmails are also sent to confirm security-related changes to a user's account, such as changing a password, updating a profile, etc. You should never allow users to unsubscribe from security-related email notifications.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[EmailCommunicationInvitation, EmailCommunicationVerification]}\\n    caption={['Two examples of email communications', '1: Invitation to join', '2: Verifying email address']}\\n/>\\n\\n## Terminated Workflows & Expired Sessions\\n\\nDuring the registration, if a user leaves the application before creating a password for their account, the whole session is treated as expired, and upon returning, they must start the registration process over again.\\n\\nIf an invitation link or verification code has expired, the users should be able to request for another invitation link or verification code.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[ExpiredCode]}\\n    caption={'Users should have a way to re-initiate an expired email verification.'}\\n    regularWidth\\n/>\\n\\n## Security Concerns\\n\\n### Error Messages\\n\\nWhen a user encounters an error \u2014 such as a password mismatch or the server is temporarily down \u2014 they should be notified with an appropriate error message. However, be very careful when presenting error messages to the users. You should only show what is necessary to recover from the problem, such as \\\"incorrect email or password\\\" or \\\"server unavailable\\\" \u2014 do not expose information that could compromise the security of your application.\\n\\n> Do **NOT** provide messages like \\\"User does not exist,\\\" \\\"Incorrect Password,\\\" etc.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[ErrorStates]}\\n    caption={\\n        'For security, you should not present more information than is necessary. For invalid credentials, you should highlight both fields and say \\\"Invalid Credentials.\\\"'\\n    }\\n    regularWidth\\n/>\\n\\n### Exposing Credentials\\n\\nUnlike a phone application, a shared HMI application is more vulnerable to outside threats via showing credentials. These projects should **NOT** implement password visibility toggles or \\\"remember me\\\" functionality.\\n\\n### Two-Factor Authentication\\n\\nThe examples on this page used email as the login credentials. However, if your project requires additional security, consider using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication involves sending an additional confirmation code (typically via email or SMS) to verify a user's identity after they enter their password.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Developers\\n\\nWe recommend using the following packages to construct these workflows.

Status colors should be used to reinforce a status or state throughout an interface. For example, an alarm row in a list may use a red colored bell icon, paired with red text and a red border stripe. When navigating to details for that alarm, the app bar may be colored red. This will solidify the association that red = alarm = bell and make it easier for a user to find alarms at a glance in an application.\\n\\n### Red\\n\\nRed is used to denote Alarms and Errors.

If you are designing exclusively for desktop applications (i.e., the illustration will never show up on mobile), you can go wider, but no more than 16:9.\\n\\n### Drawing Style\\n\\nKeep your style consistent within the application. This style should also extend to any marketing sites for the product for consistency. Do not be too abstract or artistic \u2014 your main goal is to inform your users of the features in your product, not to decorate it.\\n\\n### Text\\n\\nAvoid the use of text wherever possible. It can be hard to see on mobile and will be ineffective if your application needs to support multiple languages. If you have to use text, use Open Sans as the font and ensure that words are legible on your smallest targeted device.\\n\\n### Color\\n\\nUse the [PX Blue color palette](/style/color) for your [local colors](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_color_(visual_art)>). You should use some shade of blue in the foreground of your images (these can be colors from the Blue, Light Blue, or Branding Blue palettes).\\n\\nAvoid using colors that may blend into the application background (add a background color to to your images to help them stand out). Avoid using the 500 colors from the color palette, as they may blend in among other UI elements (buttons, etc.).\\n\\nAvoid using too many strokes, especially light strokes on dark backgrounds or vice-versa. Your illustrations may be reused as infographics, and line strokes could interfere with labels.\\n\\nTest your illustrations on both light (white 50) and dark (black 900) application backgrounds. If your application will support multiple themes, we recommended having a version of your illustrations for each.\\n\\nSimulate your illustrations under different colorblind conditions. Ensure your color schemes are still intact.\\n\\nTo maximize accessibility, use online tools (such as [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)) to simulate viewing your illustrations under different colorblind conditions. Ensure that your illustrations are still visible and effective.\\n\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[LightThemeImage, DarkThemeImage]}\\n    caption={'Two versions of the same design for light theme (left) and dark theme (right).'}\\n/>\\n<ImageGrid\\n    images={[BackgroundShapeImage]}\\n    caption={'Illustration backgrounds can be either a fixed shape (left) or full-bleed (right).'}\\n    regularWidth\\n/>\\n\\n## Export\\n\\nWhen finished with your artwork, remember to outline stroke. If you are using text in your illustrations (see above), do not convert to outline or stroke any of those elements \u2014 leave them as text for future translation, if necessary.\\n\\nName and group your root SVG layers semantically for animating. Do not minify the SVG code, as this will eliminate the naming.\\n\\nExport your illustrations as SVG with at least 2 decimal precision and presentation attributes enabled. After exporting, check that your graphics look correct (for higher detail graphics, you may need a higher decimal precision to keep paths smooth).\\n\"},\"/style/typography\":{\"title\":\"Typography\",\"text\":\"import { ImageGrid, MaterialDesignDescription } from '../../app/components';\\nimport TypeScaleImg from '../../app/assets/typography/type-scale.png';\\nimport LargerApplicationImg from '../../app/assets/typography/larger-application.png';\\nimport ApplicationImg from '../../app/assets/typography/application.png';\\nimport HeadlineOptionsImg from '../../app/assets/typography/headline-options.png';\\nimport { Divider, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: design style typography text --\x3e\\n\\n# Typography Guidelines\\n\\nPX Blue builds off of the Material Design system, so in general, you may refer to the typography guidelines presented at [Material.io](https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#).

This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letter forms.\\n\\n## Type Scale\\n\\nPX Blue provides a type scale that includes a range of styles to support the needs of your application. All styles and fonts are available in the design library. As PX Blue continues to grow, additional font patterns will be added.\\n\\n<React.Fragment>\\n    <ImageGrid images={[TypeScaleImg]} style={{ marginTop: 32 }} regularWidth />\\n    <Divider />\\n</React.Fragment>\\n\\n# Customization\\n\\nDifferent products have different needs, and we do not expect these pre-defined styles will cover every potential use case. Slight customization of these styles, such as changing a font weight in a particular component, are acceptable and expected. In most cases, you should be able to adjust existing styles without having to define an entirely new style. If you find that you must create new styles (see below), they should still use the PX Blue font (Open Sans) and adhere to our color guidelines.\\n\\n<ImageGrid images={[LargerApplicationImg]} style={{ marginTop: 32 }} regularWidth />\\n\\n## When to create custom font styles\\n\\nNew font styles can be created when a design calls for additional font sizes or states that are currently not available in PX Blue. The most common cases for custom styles have been additional headline styles (in certain components) and the modification of Body 2 from semi-bold to regular. Ultimately, the need for custom styles depends on you and what's best for the product. PX Blue is available to provide recommendations and design reviews.

We will evaluate your usage of colors, components, and layouts to ensure that the proposed idea aligns with our existing patterns and we will also evaluate the overall re-usability of what you have created. During this process, we may contact you from time to time to ask questions or discuss parts of your submission.\\n\\nIn most cases, submissions will require some amount of iteration or updates before they will be brought into the PX Blue design system. These updates can be performed by you or the PX Blue team depending on availability and timeframe. We will work with you to establish a plan for releasing the new materials and add it to one of our scheduled quarterly releases (see our [roadmap](/roadmap) for details). Depending on the nature of the materials, they will be added to our Figma library (designs), NPM packages, and/or design pattern code examples. Occasionally, code may be available for testing in the form of alpha or beta packages prior to its official release.\\n\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# Our Code\\n\\nAll of the code samples and documentation from this site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue).

How do I update to PX Blue 2.2+ if I'm currently using 2.1?\\n\\n1. First, delete the PX Blue 2.1 theme files from your project source tree.\\n2. Next, install the new themes package from NPM:\\n    - [Angular Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes)\\n    - [React Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-themes)\\n    - [React Native Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-themes)\\n3. Update your import statements to point to the npm package instead of the local file.\\n4. You'll also need to add a line to reference the Open Sans font package (where to add the line varies by framework)\\n\\nDetailed instructions can be found in our updated Framework Guides.\\n\\n-   [Angular](/development/frameworks-web/angular)\\n-   [React](/development/frameworks-web/react)\\n\\n### 2. Can I use Ionic with PX Blue?\\n\\nWith version 2.3.0, PX Blue introduced support for Ionic applications. While Ionic supports the use of a variety of frameworks for development, at this time PX Blue support is limited to Ionic 4+ applications built using Angular and Angular Material.\\n\\n### 3. Can I use Bootstrap with PX Blue?\\n\\nPX Blue does not support the use of Twitter Bootstrap for PX Blue applications. Bootstrap can cause conflicts with PX Blue components and themes and is an unnecessary addition next to the Material component libraries and frameworks supported by PX Blue. If you are accustomed to using Bootstrap for layout, you can read about the PX Blue alternative approach on our [Layout Patterns](/patterns/layout) page.\\n\\n### 4. Can I use other charting solutions (e.g., D3) with PX Blue?\\n\\nCurrently, PX Blue recommends using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) for your charting needs. If you prefer an open-source charting alternative, PX Blue also offers resources for working with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/). You can read more about this on our [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations) page. You may use other charting solutions in your application if there is a genuine business need, but keep in mind that this may compromise the consistency and reusability of your solution when compared to other projects.\\n\\n### 5. Do you have Design Patterns for...?\\n\\nWe will be continuously updating the Design Patterns section of pxblue.github.io with new patterns and code samples as they are ready. We will prioritize patterns and examples based on interest expressed from development teams. If there is something you want to see, [Contact us](/community/contactus).\\n\\nIf you have built something that you would like to share, check out our information on [innersourcing](/community/innersourcing) and [Contact Us](/community/contactus) with a demo.\\n\"},\"/community/our-team\":{\"title\":\"Our Team\",\"text\":\"import { Divider, MaintainersCards } from '../../app/components';\\n\\n\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: about history team member recruit job career --\x3e\\n\\n# The PX Blue Team\\n\\n<MaintainersCards />\\n<Divider />\\n\\n# A Brief History of PX Blue\\n\\n-   The seeds of PX Blue were sown in **2011** as a single project, Power Xpert Insight.\\n-   In **2013**, work on the Power Xpert Insight Gateway exposed a need for a shared design system between similar products.\\n-   The first iteration of PX Blue was a component library built in Polymer in **2015**.\\n-   In the summer of **2017**, difficulties with the Polymer component library led the team to conduct a full-scale design thinking project to rethink PX Blue. The team conducted extensive interviews with designers and developers to understand what they wanted out of a design system.\\n-   At the end of **2017**, the team evaluated existing open-source design systems and selected Material Design to serve as the foundation of the new PX Blue.\\n-   In February of **2018**, PX Blue 2.0 launches with support for Angular and React.\\n-   In September **2018**, PX Blue goes open source and makes all of the resources and materials available to the world. We also added support for developing mobile applications in addition to web.\\n-   In **2019**, PX Blue ramped up development of custom component libraries to supplement the components available from Material Design.\\n-   In **2020**, the team released an updated CLI for automatically starting new projects with PX Blue integration and began working on new multi-screen re-usable workflows. The team also won [two awards](https://www.designinnovationglobal.com/design-thinking/articles/di-global-awards-winners): Brand transformation and Enterprise Design Transformation.\\n\"},\"/community/contactus\":{\"title\":\"Contact Us\",\"text\":\"\x3c!-- KEYWORDS: contact email feedback questions support help --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n# Contact the PX Blue Team\\r\\n\\r\\nPX Blue is constantly evolving and adding new technical documentation, live code examples, components, and more.
