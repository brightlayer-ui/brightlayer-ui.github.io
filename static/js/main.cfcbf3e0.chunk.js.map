A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community.

Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`without`}</em>{` property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`test-id`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`dev-id`}</inlineCode>{`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer.

can greatly improve your efficiency and the quality of your products. Brightlayer UI has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from Brightlayer UI, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique. In general, we recommend trying to use Brightlayer UI for 80% of your product's needs.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Environment`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We host and maintain all `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/resources/designer\"\n      }}>{`our design assets`}</a>{` through Figma. Figma is a powerful prototyping tool that facilitates collaboration and sharing of design assets between teams. It can be used on the web, and they also provide a desktop app for Mac and Windows. In order to use Figma, you will need to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.figma.com/\"\n      }}>{`sign up`}</a>{` for an account.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Guidelines`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Brightlayer UI has design guidelines that serve as the foundation for the design system. These are intentional design choices we made to shape the Brightlayer UI brand — what Brightlayer UI applications should look like and how users should interact with them.`}</p>\n    <LinkGrid links={patternLinks} style={{\n      marginTop: 16\n    }} mdxType=\"LinkGrid\" />\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`General Guidance`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The best designs generally start with mobile first, and that's what we recommend as well when working with the Brightlayer UI design system. It's much easier to scale designs up than to scale them down.

Some devices might also have different access controls for different users (an admin who can write to the device versus a user who can only read from it).`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Number of Devices Commissioned at Once`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Will your users be unboxing and configuring many devices at once? Perhaps after 2 or 3 devices, they are comfortable with all of the steps. Your application can remember their preferences so that they don't have to perform too much repeated data entry.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Or maybe a technician is configuring an entire facility for their client, and they need to import 1000+ devices at a time? If the technician uses a batch configuration, can this process run in the background while the technician configures something else?`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expertise of Users`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The design should be tuned to fit the need of different personas. They can be non-technical users, operations / analysts, your client's engineers, your own company's engineers, or site managers. Consumer applications should contain more instructions (in texts, images, animations, or even AR) and a wider breakdown of the steps, whereas an application for technicians should emphasize more efficiency in the setup process.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Platform`}</h3>\n    <p>{`If a user is commissioning devices with a mobile phone or tablet, you can take advantage of the device camera to speed up configuration by scanning QR codes. Other technologies like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication\"\n      }}>{`near-field communication`}</a>{` (NFC) allow devices to quickly transmit a small amount of data; `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://developer.electricimp.com/manufacturing/sdkdocs/whatisblinkup\"\n      }}>{`BlinkUp`}</a>{` allows device sensors to receive data via a blinking pattern on the phone's screen. Mobile phones are easier to carry around and convenient if your devices are in crowded or hard-to-reach areas.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On the other hand, computers have the advantage for larger jobs. Their greater computing power and larger screens position them well for doing large batch configurations or jobs that require a lot of configuration details which would be difficult to fit on a mobile-sized screen.`}</p>\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`Design Tricks`}</h1>\n    <h2>{`Do not force your users to make decisions on the first go`}</h2>\n    <p>{`To minimize setup time, only require users to provide information that is essential to getting the device connected and working. For example, if the user does not specify where a device is physically located, will that prevent your dashboard from working, or is it safe to list this device as \"location unspecified\" until a later time? Let users know that they can skip these settings for now and come back in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The person doing configuration may not be the final user`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Often, users may invite experts to come to their homes or company to set up the system for them, or devices may come preconfigured from the factory. This may require some type of credential hand-off experience at the end of your workflow.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Do not force them to create an account until needed`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Accounts are often used to control the device from anywhere (web, phone, device's HMI) or manage access for different people. However, not all of these functionalities are necessary during an initial device setup. You should only prompt your users to create the account when they actually need it, rather than adding yet another step to the commissioning process.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Devices can lose connection halfway through the process`}</h2>\n    <p>{`You should never assume that devices will stay connected through the entire process. If there is a network issue, how will your application recover? Will you wait and retry in the background, pause the process, or abort the entire workflow? The application shall also try to help users identify and fix the network problem so that the same situation does not recur in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Processing time can be long`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Data transmission between devices and applications can be slow. How do you communicate this to your users if they are expecting immediate results after clicking a button in your application?`}</p>\n    <p>{`It can take a long time to initialize a device module too. If possible, you shall make use of this waiting period and have your users work on other device configurations.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`When a device is installed, its firmware might already be outdated`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There is usually a time gap between when a device is manufactured and packaged in the factory and when that device gets unboxed by your user. By the time the user plugs it in, your device's firmware might need a firmware upgrade.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Tell your users how long the upgrade might take and whether this will impact the setup process. If the upgrade is non-interruptive, you can have the process running in the background while users are doing the configuration and return to it after they are finished with everything else.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Answer users' questions where they are asked`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Your users might encounter different problems while using your application. The application should be able to help them troubleshoot in the moment. For example, if the application says that an indicator light should be blinking but it isn't, how can you help users proceed? Do they need to call your company right away, restart their router, or simply move the device closer to the WiFi connection? Often, this can be tackled with a simple \"Having trouble?\" button on the screen that can help users self-diagnose common issues.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You should also avoid using technical jargon whenever possible and provide tooltips for any terms that users may not understand. Your tooltips should not be longer than what a first-time user would need. You may include a link to external documentation if you think technical users could benefit from more detailed information.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If your configuration includes multiple steps running in the background, articulate the step names would help your users troubleshoot.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","export default
