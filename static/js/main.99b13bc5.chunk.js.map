Sometimes certain UI elements convey different meaning in different cultures. For example, in America, the red color in the stock market indicates a decline, while in China the same color indicates a rise. A thumbs-up gesture usually expresses an approval in English-speaking country, yet the gesture can have a negative meaning in Iraq. When designing for a new market, you are encouraged to have a local consultant run an audit for your application.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you are designing for webpages, instead of applications, your primary goal is to advertise your products and services, and appeal to the local market. The language tone, page style, and choice of image assets are expected to be tailored for different targeted culture.

A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`without`}</em>{` property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`test-id`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`dev-id`}</inlineCode>{`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle.

products. Brightlayer UI has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from Brightlayer UI, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique.

In this step, a user would assign locations / groups, select an icon, assign a technician, enter device descriptions, etc. Try to keep the required configuration to a minimum — give them options to skip for now and provide ways to come back or do additional configuration later. You should communicate the setup progress to your users with a `}<a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"/patterns/steppers\"\n        }}>{`stepper`}</a>{` to inform them where they are in this flow and how many more steps are ahead.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Success or failure screen`}</strong>{`: if the configuration is completed successfully, a success screen should present users with options to add more devices or quit and view the device list / dashboard. This screen usually has a humorous and cheerful tone. If the configuration fails, you should inform the user why and what steps they need to perform to fix the error.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Setting Up Multiple Devices at Once`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Configuring many devices simultaneously (batch configuration) requires advanced preparation and is usually handled by skilled personnel. Because of the advanced preparation, a batch configuration requires fewer steps and instructions within your application. The workflow would consist of the following:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Prepare devices and configuration file`}</strong>{`: a screen to remind the user to prepare their devices for discovery and a button to upload the configuration file.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Upload the configuration file`}</strong>{`: this is usually a CSV file with predefined parameters that describe all of the target devices.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Indicate current progress`}</strong>{`: show which devices have been set up successfully and which ones are running into trouble. Show the progress and an estimate of the time remaining.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Success or failure screen`}</strong>{`: similar to the individual device workflow, you should show the user what has succeeded and what has failed. You may wish to provide the option to add more devices, finalize details that the system could not interpret from the configuration file, or go back to the dashboard or the device list.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`Design Variations`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Multiple factors may require you to adjust or deviate from the general steps outlined above. The following are some items you may need to consider when designing the commissioning workflow for your application.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Device Type`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Connection protocols can vary by device — some may use Bluetooth or WiFi while others may require being hardwired via Ethernet. Some devices might also have different access controls for different users (an admin who can write to the device versus a user who can only read from it).`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Number of Devices Commissioned at Once`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Will your users be unboxing and configuring many devices at once? Perhaps after 2 or 3 devices, they are comfortable with all of the steps. Your application can remember their preferences so that they don't have to perform too much repeated data entry.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Or maybe a technician is configuring an entire facility for their client, and they need to import 1000+ devices at a time? If the technician uses a batch configuration, can this process run in the background while the technician configures something else?`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expertise of Users`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The design should be tuned to fit the need of different personas. They can be non-technical users, operations / analysts, your client's engineers, your own company's engineers, or site managers. Consumer applications should contain more instructions (in texts, images, animations, or even AR) and a wider breakdown of the steps, whereas an application for technicians should emphasize more efficiency in the setup process.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Platform`}</h3>\n    <p>{`If a user is commissioning devices with a mobile phone or tablet, you can take advantage of the device camera to speed up configuration by scanning QR codes. Other technologies like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication\"\n      }}>{`near-field communication`}</a>{` (NFC) allow devices to quickly transmit a small amount of data; `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://developer.electricimp.com/manufacturing/sdkdocs/whatisblinkup\"\n      }}>{`BlinkUp`}</a>{` allows device sensors to receive data via a blinking pattern on the phone's screen. Mobile phones are easier to carry around and convenient if your devices are in crowded or hard-to-reach areas.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On the other hand, computers have the advantage for larger jobs. Their greater computing power and larger screens position them well for doing large batch configurations or jobs that require a lot of configuration details which would be difficult to fit on a mobile-sized screen.`}</p>\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`Design Tricks`}</h1>\n    <h2>{`Do not force your users to make decisions on the first go`}</h2>\n    <p>{`To minimize setup time, only require users to provide information that is essential to getting the device connected and working. For example, if the user does not specify where a device is physically located, will that prevent your dashboard from working, or is it safe to list this device as \"location unspecified\" until a later time? Let users know that they can skip these settings for now and come back in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The person doing configuration may not be the final user`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Often, users may invite experts to come to their homes or company to set up the system for them, or devices may come preconfigured from the factory. This may require some type of credential hand-off experience at the end of your workflow.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Do not force them to create an account until needed`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Accounts are often used to control the device from anywhere (web, phone, device's HMI) or manage access for different people. However, not all of these functionalities are necessary during an initial device setup. You should only prompt your users to create the account when they actually need it, rather than adding yet another step to the commissioning process.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Devices can lose connection halfway through the process`}</h2>\n    <p>{`You should never assume that devices will stay connected through the entire process. If there is a network issue, how will your application recover? Will you wait and retry in the background, pause the process, or abort the entire workflow? The application shall also try to help users identify and fix the network problem so that the same situation does not recur in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Processing time can be long`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Data transmission between devices and applications can be slow. How do you communicate this to your users if they are expecting immediate results after clicking a button in your application?`}</p>\n    <p>{`It can take a long time to initialize a device module too. If possible, you shall make use of this waiting period and have your users work on other device configurations.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`When a device is installed, its firmware might already be outdated`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There is usually a time gap between when a device is manufactured and packaged in the factory and when that device gets unboxed by your user. By the time the user plugs it in, your device's firmware might need a firmware upgrade.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Tell your users how long the upgrade might take and whether this will impact the setup process. If the upgrade is non-interruptive, you can have the process running in the background while users are doing the configuration and return to it after they are finished with everything else.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Answer users' questions where they are asked`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Your users might encounter different problems while using your application. The application should be able to help them troubleshoot in the moment. For example, if the application says that an indicator light should be blinking but it isn't, how can you help users proceed? Do they need to call your company right away, restart their router, or simply move the device closer to the WiFi connection? Often, this can be tackled with a simple \"Having trouble?\" button on the screen that can help users self-diagnose common issues.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You should also avoid using technical jargon whenever possible and provide tooltips for any terms that users may not understand. Your tooltips should not be longer than what a first-time user would need. You may include a link to external documentation if you think technical users could benefit from more detailed information.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If your configuration includes multiple steps running in the
